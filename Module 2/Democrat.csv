I would argue he's worse! Atleast Hitler was a soldier and a painter and lived in a failed economy with genuine poverty , persecution and lack of anything post ww1.  

The German people were suffering which lead them to extremes. Hitler took advantage of that and  atleast on some level believed he was making a better Germany.  

BUT I cannot say I believe Trump wants a better America.   Trump the draft dodger whose not a starving artist but a billionaire!  And America is one of the riches nations on earth!  

So Hitler was about as bad as you can be but Trump is somehow so much worse as he has no excuse.  But like Hitler, Trump will fail! Two losers together in hell.

**Edit:** *I'll add to this Fox news is clearly Trump's propaganda arm (or was) and all too similar to Hitler's radio division. And I guess that would make Tucker Carlson a modern day Goebbels?*",ilivedownyourroad,20,2022-09-19 18:36:21,QAnon,-0.03639705882352941,ilivedownyourroad

democrats,"RFK Jr. says Deep State ‘is real,’ called FDA employees ‘sock puppet’ of industry",78,"Q from QAnon said the Deep State was a cabal of pedos who existed for one reason and one reason only--to destroy Trump.  MAGA believes the Deep State is everyone who is not them.  Trump believes the Deep State is everyone who is not him and his immediate family. For a couple of decades the Heritage Foundation believed the Deep State are the unelected bureaucrats.

How come none of these people ever think that maybe they are the Deep State?

As an aside, going back a few decades, the far-left believed the Deep State was the corporations that really controlled government, or the Illuminati, One World Order, etc.  At least the far-left's concept was more believable.

There is some truth to RFK, Jr's comments here --business has been in the habit of wrapping itself around what-ever Fed Agency or Office it has direct ties to.  Kinda funny, though, considering who Trump currently has in his Administration.  I guess it is not the Deep State when it is out in the open?

Also, when RFK, Jr. was a kid, practically no-one was diagnosed with autism.  Back then, they just got labeled a problem child and sent off to boarding school, disciplined, etc. There is some talk these days about why so many children are now being diagnosed with some attributing it to better diagnostic tools and others saying that it is too easy these days and many are being diagnosed who otherwise should not be.

His comments about environmental toxins are kinda bizarre.  Not that they are wrong, but that they, along with other things that he says, goes counter to what Trump and his Admin are currently doing.  But also, he hasn't been doing much himself to clean the air and water.  I am pretty sure that Trump only tapped him because of his anti-vaxx stance as it is a middle finger to Dr. Fauci.",crucial_geek,11,2025-04-14 20:23:35,deep state,0.11742424242424243,Nerd-19958

That's the problem with all of these ""conspiracy against Trump"" narratives from the impeachments to the 2020 election - in every one of their stories Trump is portrayed to be the weak and frail victim without any agency of his own, regardless of whether he's a private citizen or the fucking President. A strong leader wouldn't constantly be getting pushed around like this by the people he hires. 

They're always dancing around the fact that Trump had no clue what he's supposed to be doing for most of his time in office. It's always his hires undermining him or the Democrats persecuting him.

democrats,CNN to Trump: You incited this,1489,"Numerous pipe bombs have been sent to leaders of the Democratic Party and vocal critics of the President. The Obamas, Clintons, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Maxine Waters, George Soros, Robert De Niro, and John Brennan (care of CNN) were all the targets of a attempted assassination. This list easily reads as a political hit list of the President’s favorite enemies, a President that celebrates violence and encourages the hateful rhetoric of modern politics. While many politicians in the past have played on our differences, dividing Americans, Trump has enflamed those divisions for political gain.

During campaign rallies, he routinely encouraged violence against protestors - even offering to pay the legal fees (he didn’t end up paying). Trump “joked” about 2nd Amendment solutions should Clinton win After the election, he defended the white supremacists in Charlottesville that not only beat counter protestors with sticks, bats and shields but also murdered a woman by driving a car into the crowd. During these midterm rallies, he has attacked Democrats an a angry mob that will use violence if they win back Congress (which makes no sense whatsoever, but that’s who he is). He still leads chants of lock her up, though exactly who and for what isn’t exactly clear other than political opponents (Ted Cruz also got into this by saying that his opponent Beto O’Rourke should be jailed, I guess for running against him). And just last week he celebrated a Republican representative that plead guilty to assaulting a reporter that simply asked the candidate their position on repealing the ACA. Celebrated him as an American journalist was murdered by the Saudis (who only made the Saudi enemies list when he criticized Trump). As he calls the press the enemy of the people, encouraging despots around the world to imprison and murder journalists without American retribution.

I am clearly not saying that Trump built and sent these bombs. That is the fault entirely of the bomber. But this political environment is entirely the fault of President Trump. Well, Trump and the people that support him. It is no coincidence that racists chant Trump’s name as a they harass people of a darker hue as it elicits a strong feeling of pride in the white supremacists amongst us. And I don’t just mean the frothing MAGA-hat-wearers who cheered on his celebrations of violence in real time. Republican politicians either completely ignored or mildly rebuked his rhetoric while completely caved to his hate to win an election. It’s also the fault of all of those that voted for him. You had a chance to show him and other hate mongers, that incitement of political violence remains unacceptable in America and you failed spectacularly. He faced no electoral punishment for his behaviors and you rewarded with an unexpected victory.

Yesterday, as events unfolded, the President meekly read from a statement prepared by his staff. He did not stand with the former Presidents that had been targeted. But he read, the absolute minimal statement he needed to. And that lasted for less than a day. As political opponents received more packages, he went back to the campaign trail. While he did not aggressively attack as he normally did, he did demonstrate that he doesn’t care. He mocked the idea of his own statement- saying he can be good for awhile. Then this morning he attacked the mainstream media for this situation. Because reporting on Trump’s hateful rhetoric is their fault, for repeating his words and actions. The Press Secretary (who no longer holds daily press briefings) said that it was CNN’s fault for receiving a bomb at their office.

Trump and the Republicans will not unify the country. The entire Republican platform is about fear and hate. They want to encourage the haters to get out to vote. Those that hate blacks, hate Hispanics, hate Muslims, hate immigrants, hate gays, hate trans people, hate liberals and so on. They have always done this. But now their leader actively encourages the violence that follows. Hate crimes surged in 2017 against Jews and Muslims as the White House said nothing. White supremacists feel entitled to march in the streets, even starting a brawl last week in NYC. The President says nothing, and in fact purposefully describes himself as a nationalist (exactly what those people want).

The President and his party will not change. But we can change them. We are a week away from the end of the midterm election - voting is going on right now. You can vote to support the hate and violence further emboldening Trump. Or you can condemn it by voting for the Democrats. I think the choice is simple. We are all Americans. We are not enemies. We may be opponents for sure, but we are not enemies. And we should not reward the political party that doesn't seem to understand this.",deaconheel,9,2018-10-25 07:39:33,false flag,-0.025334821428571408,progress18

I can't find any sources that say the bombs can't be detonated. I did see that there was an ISIS sticker on one and some of the names were incorrectly spelled on the addresses. The bomb material is real, as is the detonator.

None of them went off, which would suggests to me an amateur built the bombs and was dumb enough to think a sticker would throw off the investigation in case one of them was intercepted.

> J6 Convict Removed from Fauci Hearing
> Brandon Fellows had to be removed from the hearing.
> Ron FilipkowskiUpdated:9 hours agoOriginal:9 hours ago
> J6 defendant Brandon Fellows had to be removed from the House Committee hearing today where Dr. Anthony Fauci was called to testify. 
> 
> A number of J6ers were in attendance at the hearing, including Michael Flynn associate Ivan Raiklin who sat right behind Fauci with Fellows so they could mug for the cameras while attempting to mock him. Raiklin waited for Fauci to arrive this morning, and followed him down the hallway yelling conspiracies at him while accusing him of mass murder.
> 
> As Fauci was describing the credible death threats against himself and his family, he choked up when mentioning his daughters, while Raiklin and Fellows made faces behind him. (Raiklin on left, Fellows on right).
> 
> Fellows was then finally removed from the hearing, and on his way out the door he yelled that Fauci should be in prison.
> 
> Fellows was sentenced on February 27, 2024 to 42 months in prison for his role in J6. After breaking into the Capitol, Fellows sat at Senator Jeff Merkley's desk and smoked marijuana in his office while putting his feet up on the desk. 
> 
> At his sentencing hearing, 5 additional months in prison was added to his sentence for contempt of court after he yelled at the jury foreman during the reading of his guilty verdict and called it a ""modern-day Nazi court."" He had three years of credit for the time he spent in prison so he was recently released. Fellows is still on three years of probation though, and today's conduct could possibly result in his probation being violated with a return to prison for the insurrectionist. 
> 
> Fellows represented himself at trial, and at sentencing Judge McFadden said he ""made a mockery of this trial,"" showed ""the height of contempt,"" and ""flagrantly lied"" during his testimony. McFadden's parting words to Fellows were, ""I hope you grow up.""
> 
> Obviously, that hope was in vain.
