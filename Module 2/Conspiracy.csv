Impeaching a POTUS for targetting corruption

Human trafficking brought to the public's attention,  especially regarding children

Kevin Spacey

Prince Andrew

Cuties movie/normalizing Pedophilia

And the mass spreading of Pizzagate/pedo activity at the highest levels of fame and power. Millions of people who were unaware of these things, are very aware now.



And ask yourself what they all have in common? (Obvious answer. Pedo related/trafficking and corruption)


Then ask yourself what are the odds all these events come to light and get spread globally to MANY people who were previously unaware of such atrocities.

Conspiracy,I read in the news about the Qanon thing. Crazy!,5939,"Tell me if this makes sense:

Hunter Biden is at the center of a massive bribery ring involving the leadership of the Democratic party, Russia, China, and Ukraine. He keeps evidence of these highly illegal activities on a laptop. He also keeps, on this same laptop, child pornography, and evident that he’s sleeping with his cousin. For good measure, he puts a Hunter Biden sticker on the computer.

It breaks or something, and instead of getting it fixed where he lives, or sending it to Apple, or going to an Apple Store, he flies across the US. When he lands he avoids one of the busiest Apple stores in the world in the Christiana Mall and finds some hole in the wall computer repair shop in Wilmington. There, he entrusts it to a legally blind man who can’t positively identify him, whose security cameras are not working that day.

Hunter then abandons this laptop, which contains the dark secrets of the Democratic party, leaving it sitting in this computer repair shop where the computer repair guy goes through his files, apparently breaking some serious encryption to do so. He hands it over to the FBI, initially based on emails about Ukraine that this random computer guy in this podunk-ass town somehow recognized as being about something illegal.

The laptop then disappears, but somehow, Rudy Giuliani, who was in Ukraine looking for dirt on Hunter Biden, real or fake, in a series of activities that led to the impeachment of the President, acquires this data.

Yet, we don’t hear about it until two weeks ago.

The kiddie porn isn’t there until last week.

The incest isn’t there until this week.

There is no corroborating evidence, Biden has released his tax returns, and law enforcement has had nothing to say about this. The only ones covering it are the New York Post and right wing tabloids. The Wall Street Journal issued a statement rebuking their own editorial department for writing on it.

So this laptop, which has Hunter Biden’s name on it in sticker form, has a treasure trove of incriminating evidence. It was important enough to fly across the country (for no readily apparent reason) to get it repaired  but not important enough to remember to pick it up. That’s right, the secrets of the cabal were entrusted to the recovering drug addict son of Joe Biden who forgot he left them behind at the repair shop.

We learned about all this from a guy who was part of a conspiracy to produce fake allegations and fraudulent evidence against Joe Biden and his family, which led to the impeachment of the President.

Even the details you mentioned, things not portrayed in a positive light, etc. are aspects of this hagiography of Facebook meant to make this mythical origin story authentic and believable.  But it is very weird and abnormal that such a film would be released so close to the inception of the subject it is enshrining the myth about.  The film literally was released a few years after the inception and supposed events depicted.  It would be like a big Hollywood studio making a biopic about a famous musician while they were still alive, before they actually died.  Usually such films are released after the person dies, as a remembrance, so like Ray Charles or Johnny Cash: this is more like a biopic coming out about Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus (or another completely fake celebrity whose image was manufactured in a business meeting).  

This Facebook myth story is such an obvious tell, a distraction from the real murky deep state origins of Facebook, which was financed by In-Q-Tel (a CIA front for laundering money) and was developed for intel agencies by DARPA as Lifelog and then sold to the public as an organically created new tech project developed on a college campus by nerdy teenagers (which is much more disarming than the truth).  It created a discussion about Zuckerberg and the Winkelvoss twins which was itself a distraction from the real story: a limited hangout.  

It's very much reminiscent of Barack Obama's origin myth: the fact that this upcoming politician who nobody knew about at all, who out of the blue skyrocketed to the limelight, had a book about his origins (Dreams of My Father) extremely early in his career, way before public figures typically release such material.  

For Obama this served the same purpose as the entire birther nonsense, which was a distraction intended to lump anyone doing true inquiry or investigation into Obama's back story in with racists and Xenophobia and ignorance (Trump was the guy chosen to lead this limited hangout operation by the way, if you recall).  

The reality with Obama is that he literally sealed his records immediately after entering office as president. There's something he doesn't want anyone to know, and he's hiding it from the public, and it's not that he's secretly Muslim or born in Kenya  (as I said, these were distractions to prevent any actual real and legitimate questions or investigation and associate any questions with racist motives).  His period at Occidental College and how he transitioned to Columbia is incredibly murky, and what is being hidden about Obama is that he was a high level CIA covert ops guy. He was involved in training the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, working with people like Osama bin Laden.  His parents are obviously spooks: his mother being in Indonesia etc, she worked for a CIA cutout organization, and the father was involved in a US intel agency front (the USA uses legitimate diplimatic channels as cover for their spies, just like the American woman in the UK who hit and killed a young man on his motor bike, she claimed originally to be a diplomat, the wife of an embassy employee, when in reality she was a CIA spook stationed at the embassy).  

Obama's family have all the hallmarks of intel agency operatives, and of course they would have cover stories for their time spent in various places around the world.  But Obama himself is a product of the deep state and CIA, which is actually where he got all of his training etc, but then pretty early on he was directed into a path to legitimate himself, was brought into Columbia and the rest of the story is true and authentic, lending credibility to his plausible deniability cover story.  

Years ago, early on in Obama's presidency, I read some extremely convincing articles on this topic on Salon magazine's website by a woman named Stuart Jeanne Bramhall who had a sort of column there (they have since been removed -- I think Salon at that time would host content from bloggers on their platform).  They were called Obama's CIA origins or something like that and it was a multi part series.  If anyone can find these articles please post them here

Look these terms up and you will see quite a clear picture painted before you.

After that, entertain these facts and judge for yourself if it's a coincidence or not.

On July 12th, 2024, the first Captain America Brave New World trailer released. This movie is inspired by the plot to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Here is the plot:

""Brave New World,"" a dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley, explores a futuristic society where technology and conditioning control every aspect of human life, prioritizing stability and happiness over individuality and freedom""

Anyways, the Captain America Brave New World trailer released on 7/12/2024. In the movie, Harrison Ford plays as the corrupt president who is doing anything possible to usher in a totalitarian new world order.

The very next day, on 7/13/2024, Trump is shot in the head on Harrison Ford's birthday at 6:11pm

116 days later Trump wins the election on 11/6/2024

119 days after Trump was shot, on 11/9/2024, the 2nd Captain America Brave New World trailer releases. In this trailer, you can see the words RESET AMERICA plain as day at 1 minute 28 seconds. You can see for yourself

https://youtu.be/1pHDWnXmK7Y?si=qomia4wQTHoPrIS1

In the trailer you may also notice a lot of cherry blossom trees, this is because it was signaling for cherry blossom season, which is right now.

April is the month of Rebirth, the full moon in April is known as the awakening moon. Easter is celebrated this month as the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Just yesterday during Trumps Liberation Day speech, he literally said that ""April 2nd, 2025 will be remembered as the day the American industry was Reborn""

Here is the official post from the white house today

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DH_DlgURvej/?igsh=MXE2NjdsY21yd2p2YQ==

To top this all off, Jurassic World ""Rebirth"" is coming out soon

Bleach ""Rebirth"" of Souls just released

DareDevil ""Born Again"" just released

Kendrick Lamar performed his song ""Reincarnated"" at the superbowl

Trumps newly appointed Ambassador of Hollywood Mel Gibson is producing Passion of the Christ 2: ""Resurrection"" soon

Interesting that these Rebirth themes are abundant at the moment, right when Trump says that the country is being Reborn, no? Is everything highly organized or are these just coincidences? I have many more examples that tie into all of this as well

Remember, it's cherry blossom season. And Elons child's mother Grimes posted an apocalyptic prophecy leading up to the Great reset, and the last line before the reset begins is the cherry blossom emoji 🌸

https://x.com/Grimezsz/status/1722446656019607749?t=CsSifdvkldYn5mEqYa8cnA&s=19

Just last month, Grimes did an interview with Time magazine where she literally says ""Luckily, there's a massive population drop coming, so, maybe it will be like fate and everything will just work out""

It's around the 19:20 mark in this video

https://youtu.be/XuA0oLxz-xc?si=aOXM-NwmW-OmIs9J

Here is Grimes most recent music video ""So Heavy I fell through the Earth"" which shows an eclipse and cherry blossom petals flying in the wind...

https://youtu.be/eLo1pQ45XYs?si=BfprwWngdN3ngr8c

Will these things occur? Probably not, it's a risky game, but as an American, I would be extremely happy if they did occur. I know for a fact I've been extremely unhappy with the status quo of the United States and the world police military industrial open wallet status we've held here for so long. Is it so surprising that someone like Trump could come in and offer a glimmer of hope to people who believe what he says? 

I remain cautiously optimistic, I don't like alot of what he does and says, and he's most likely controlled by Israel/Mossad/Blackmail apparatus. But I sincerely hope and wish that what he says and pushes for works out, because if it's not just a globalist ploy, then it's a shakeup of a severely broken system. 

I'm very certain at this point that there's dark god worshiping globalists that use ritual magic through hollywood media to mass manipulate consciousness. I haven't seen convincing evidence that Trump is part of this group. I have the feeling he's part of an opposing faction, but obviously only time will reveal his allegiances. Back to the tariffs and how this could help: 

The obvious one is bringing back industry to the United States by making it cheaper to manufacture goods here than it is to manufacture them overseas. The amount of pollution created by shipping everything back and forth across the oceans is insane. Local manufacturing is the key to sovereignty and balance with nature.  The jobs created in America alone would be worth it. 

I truly believe that exploitative capitalism at its core is morally wrong. And preventing corporations from exploiting cheap labor by tariffing the shit out them is a net positive for ALL of humanity. 

Using the tariff income to lower, or completely replace all taxes in favor a flat tax (say 10% on all non essential goods) would make it so being able to afford American made products isn't out of reach. 

I sincerely hope that things play out in the way I just stated... but is the global cabal too entrenched and we're all just being played for fools? Probably. But it costs nothing to remain optimistic, and if you're the type of person to beleive that consciousness creates reality, then you have a moral duty to focus on and EXPECT the world you want to see, not the fear induced blindfold that's forced down your throat everyday",4thdimensionalshift,16,2025-04-03 22:43:35,deep state,0.041485489818823156,earthtochas3

Go start a company producing a product in the US and you won’t be subject to tariffs, which means you can charge 25% more for your good, and pay your employees 25% more for their labour while remaining competitive.

Everyone has been heard.

The Trump fandom has been claiming that the election was a fraud since polling started to show it would go against the president (Trump himself said that if he lost he would assume it was fraud). No evidence was ever presented and at this point it's just damaging to the election process because it's actively reducing confidence in an election system that, for all it's faults, is pretty resilient.

Also to your original point, you're confused about the definition of ""election fraud."" Election fraud isn't any of the may grievences that Democrats were bringing over the past several years (except in one case in which there was actual election fraud committed by one person in one county to support their Republican candidates).

Election interference is not election fraud. (and widespread election interference was found to have occurred and have been instigated by the Russians by a Republican-lead Senate committee along with every intelligence agency in the American Intelligence Community).

Campaign finance violations are not election fraud. (and campaign finance violations were found to have occurred on several fronts by the courts at both the state and federal levels)

So... where are the court cases that have shown any actual election fraud outside of that one case from 2016? Feel free to present actual evidence and I'm sure you'll be on national TV tomorrow...",Tyler_Zoro,0,2021-02-09 15:42:10,election fraud,0.049444444444444444,Silent-Difficulty

Of the 80 total lawsuits brought by Trump or those outside his camp in support of election integrity, 34 have either been withdrawn, consolidated with other suits, or dismissed due to legal technicalities such as lack of standing, timing, or jurisdiction. Those judges who dismissed suits never heard the actual evidence of election irregularities and/or fraud. Since they did not allow it to be presented in their courtrooms, such cases cannot be counted as a win or loss for Trump. If anything, they are evidence of a failure of our judicial system to – at a moment of national crisis – actually address concerns of election fraud.

Of the 46 remaining lawsuits, 25 cases are still ongoing, so that the winner and loser of these cases is yet to be determined, while 21 have been completely adjudicated. These are cases where the court heard arguments, considered any relevant evidence, and then issued a formal ruling on the merits.

There's some fascinating research by Holman et al. from UC Irvine that might make you rethink what you know about the Boston bombing. They studied about 5,000 Americans before and after the event, and here's the kicker: people who only watched the news coverage experienced *more* acute stress than those who were actually at the bombing site. Let that sink in.

This isn't about whether the bombing was real or not - it's about how the media can turn a localized tragedy into a nationwide trauma. The constant replays, the dramatic headlines, the emotional interviews - they're all designed to keep us glued to our screens, but at what cost?

Think about it: if watching the news causes more stress than being at the actual event, who benefits from that? It's not us, that's for sure. Maybe the real conspiracy is how the media uses these events to control our emotional state and keep us dependent on their coverage.

So next time something big goes down, ask yourself: am I watching this because I need to know, or because someone wants me to feel a certain way? Stay vigilant, but don't let the fear-mongering control you.",infernion,719,2024-08-21 22:41:53,false flag,0.15834920634920638,Temporary_Pause7800

Another interesting stat is that there is 393,000,000 guns in the U.S. that we know of. Only 0.004% of guns are used to kill others. That's a pretty good record of responsible gun ownership-- 99.996%. 

The problem with restriction is the criteria that is the slippery slope. You already have background checks, that is how felons and dishonorable discharged vets are denied rights to guns. Yet, felons are caught with guns despite this.. 

The criteria begins to be subjective. ""Oh his ideology is 'too far', denied."" What is 'too far'? Who's ideology is 'right'? What is 'mental illness' when 40 million people in the U.S. are under psychiatric prescriptions? 

What is 'too much' for weapons? This will continually be added upon. Every government restriction or 'addon' is furthered inch by inch after you allow it. Patriot Act for example. 

The other question you have to ask yourself, is the government going to remain 'trustworthy', forever? It won't devolve, just like every government in civilized history? Obviously it will, at some point, and probably sooner than later, and what will an unarmed or limited populous going to do, exactly? 

Does the current government have consistency in its morals and rhetoric? The same government that funds and arms terrorists, protects pedophiles, traffics cocaine onto U.S. citizens for black money, CONTELPROs dissenting activists and groups, and creates false flags to send us to war for corporate interests-- a trustworthy entity to allow to enact gun restrictions on its citizens? While it ships missiles and tanks to extremists across the globe?

""a plan secretly devised to accomplish an evil or treacherous end.""

""Did You Know?

Noun

In A Child's History of England, Charles Dickens associates the word cabal with a group of five ministers in the government of England's King Charles II. The initial letters of the names or titles of those men (Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale) spell cabal, and Dickens dubbed them the ""Cabal Ministry."" These five men were widely regarded as invidious, secretive plotters and their activities may have encouraged English speakers to associate cabal with high-level government intrigue. But their names are not the source of the word cabal, which was in use decades before Charles II ascended the throne. The term can be traced back through French to cabbala, the Medieval Latin name for the Kabbalah, a traditional system of esoteric Jewish mysticism.""",Settlemente,15,2021-02-05 06:19:32,cabal,-0.15,openmind24

Want to know why your little subreddit was banned? Because it was promoting witch hunting, which is plainly against reddit's rules, and has been since the sites inception. 

There are very real issues in the world today facing the entire human race. Issues that this subreddit could do well fighting against. Remember that video of the two children speaking out against a pedophile ring? Remember the atrocities our (and many other) governments commit every day? 

And *THIS* is what gets stickied? Sjw witch hunting? Fuck.

[–]jod1177 1 point 10 hours ago 

What can be done to protect the integrity of reddit then? Ban the users, and put up strick guidelines and screening measures asking why they want to join? No. Use their ip address to prohibit any one from its address in signing up? No, too many ways around that. Employ paid hunter killer redditors to figure out the new accounts they are signing up with, shutting them down in a permanent game of wack a mole?

Being new to reddit, sounds like the work is cut out for the site administrators, and who ever approves mods. This has the potential imo to turn into a witch hunt, that the only thing that can stop it is a temporary freeze on new membership, to stop the bleeding, then eliminate the cancer, not just by banning the account, but by figuring out who these little reddit terrorists are and start taking them down where they are trying to harass people.

I like this site, its going to suck if a bunch of little dick insecure bitches who have nothing better to do, shuts this site down, or causes so much drama that the site is no longer fun to use. I am all for people haveing their own view points, opinions, and a place to express them and exchange idea's with one another. I dont down vote people that I dont agree with what they are saying. I appreciate counter points on issues, and debating them. Its how we learn.

People are so quick to get butt hurt here, because they disagree with what you are saying and down vote you like the kid at the playgroud who takes his ball and leaves cause they loose.

This sadly has become their main interaction with people, and is where they feel they are on equal ground or have the advantage, because truth of the matter like you said, if they acted like that in the real world, they would get their ass kicked, and probably have.

They can have their opinions, beliefs, feelings, im all for it. But when they start to act like Nazi's and not able to be put in check, this site will probably end up like you are fearing.

The only things I can think that would mabye stop it is diligence from the people approving mods, banning the accounts of the ""cabal"".

A freeze on new accounts is a terrible idea, but either not giving them ""voting rights"" for a certain period of time, or give them the illusions that their votes count, observing thier voting habbits with a bot that monitors them, when they are observed being reddit terriostits going into someones page and downvoting all their stuff, shut em down.

I think a 30 day period for new accounts not being able to vote would help. If someone pisses you off, most sane people are not going to wait 30 days to down vote someone. Then set up monitors for ""bulliing"" votes.

I think that moderators that are shadow banning people, deleting peoples posts, or collabaroting against users, or subs should be banned from this site. The only way I think post should be removed is already in the reddit rules. Maybe even requiring a year of redditing before you can qualify as a mod.

Or find a trusted group of mods who have not partaken in the bs that was going on to be reddits own secret super mods callit the RIA, to monitor them.

The administrators at reddit have some tough decisions. Left unchecked, this site will go the way of myspace. (i dont know the history of digg)

Or will have to unfortunately go on a temporary witch hunt, clear the crap out, have a plan or system in place to prevent the crap from coming back in by changing policies on new accounts voting ability, heavely scrutinizing posts from the new users have approved by actual human mods during that time, to prevent obvious manipulation and sabatoging of the subs. That should stop the bleeding.

Using fire to fight fire isn't alsways the best answer, but at some point they will make it come to that. Just from reading what you had to say there is no way around it.

I do hope you get it figured out, because that is absolute bull shit to let a bunch of little punks ruin the site. As it is, they are going to at the least effect new membership policies. Good luck.

That is the exact definition of retalation, on a public forum, reddit is on us soil, and im looking into if this is in violation of first amendment rights. Or CA laws. 

if you have any information, please let me know, im diving into this now.

The U.S. isn’t just engaging in random trade wars—it’s actively reshaping the world order to consolidate power before 2030.

This ties directly into the New World Order agenda. By destabilizing allies and enemies alike, the U.S. ensures that when the dust settles, it holds the dominant position in the new system. The tariffs, sanctions, and geopolitical tensions aren’t about economic fairness; they’re strategic moves to break down existing global institutions and force every nation into a position where they must negotiate on America’s terms.

At the same time, the engineered blackouts, digital surveillance, and financial manipulation are working in tandem to create a controlled collapse. When the old system fully breaks, the masses—left desperate and isolated—will be forced to accept the new system, whether it’s a global digital currency, biometric ID systems, or even centralized emergency response measures like FEMA camps.

Conspiracy,You’re Being Lied To – The U.S. is Quietly Reshaping the World Order,1401,"Central banking cartels own world governments.  Look at the Wall Street putsch aka the business plot from the 30s. It was these same rich elite social circles that went on to fund the worker's party in Germany and invested in their crumbled economy (treaty of Versailles concessions)that allowed Germany to build up it's military. These guys, including the father of a lineage of us president's, Prescott Bush, were never openly exposed in the Nuremberg trails, so they and their fascist one world order ideologies lived on. The next generation just picked up where they left off. Bush's three terms, Jr was an extension as daddy's corny. Dick Cheney was pulling Jr ear around Washington, leading him. But to back up a little to where the US became a plutocracy without the masses noticing several decades ago.  The first step was the creation of the federal reserve.  Created a currency easily controlled by a few set the stage. Then Truman signed the national security act of 47 which gave a lot of power to unelected berucrats who gave the world the like of saddam Hussain and many other puppets they groomed to take control of nations during their regime change operations which they helped fund. Please note the men who helped establish some of these agencies.  Bill Donavan, the dulles brothers( all corporate lawyers) they infiltrated governments to influence global trade markets to benefit their banking overlords. Since nato was founded to keep America in, communism out and Germany down in the European Union and with the fall of the Ussr @ 91 and crumbling of the Warsaw pact nato just became the foreign policy in the European union which was totally dependent upon the us war machine who used a game theory political mindset with its foreign policies led to less communication between nations but rather put more emphasis on intelligence gathering which was highly manipulated by their leadership to set plots in place to covertly expand their secret plan of a one world fascist government.  The us controlled the European unions foreign policies while lseral controls us foreign policies through espionage operations, which includes epstein and maxwell BTW. Zelensky is a puppet of the war machine within Washington that tulsi gabbard openly talks about.  In my earlier years, the deep state, the unelected berucrats given power by the national security act of 47, was heavily in bed with the GOP political party.  There was a shift after bush sr to what was branded as the new democratic party with Obama or soetoro, his step father sir name, who was recruited by the deep state, groomed him for his role.  He ran on the platform of change but turned into another puppet for the banks. Bailouts with no security on taxpayers' money lent. Trump 45 was unorganized and green to the inner circles of power within Washington and allowed establishment politicians into his administration who blocked any potential issues the administration may have presented. Biden was installed because of his relationship with Obama, who fooled the world. Winning a peace award while helping set the stage for both the European conflict and the current Middle Eastern conflict with Iran funded Hamas /Israel.  Netanyahu is a war criminal.  I'm not saying all of lseral but the government he runs.  Most world governments serve the banks, not the citizens.  The cultural ideology to push hate between Palestinians and Israeli between both cultures creates this never-ending wsr between the two while a bank profits from the two killing each other. A story repeated across the world.  The trump 47 administration seems to have learned from its previous administration. He has put anti-establishment members in his cabinet, rooting out mic operatives from cabinet positions. So far. So good.  Hopefully, he remains on track.  The world was really close to ww3.  If the Biden administration or if the deep state would have gotten its way with a perfered Hailey/pompeo gop ticket, the world would have been in serious danger.  It still exists with the opportunity of false flags, but with the correct people in place, it is much less likely. Ramble over.  Read everything.

Conspiracy,Do you guys believe in the New World Order conspiracy?,46,"Here are few conspiracy nut-jobs who do:

John Dewey used the term ""world state.""  I believe Francis Galton used the same term; he was a big proponent of the League of Nations, and he coined the term ""eugenics."" The Rockefellers donated the land upon which the UN sits; they also funded eugenics. Lord Esher used the term ""new world order"" in 1935 and spoke of preparing public opinion for global governance. H.G. Wells published a book entitled New World Order in 1940, as well as a book entitled The Open Conspiracy wherein he openly speaks of a world state. Edward Mandel House was Woodrow Wilson's advisor/handler and very instrumental in pushing Wilson toward the Federal Reserve Act. He wrote a book wherein the main character becomes a world dictator. When Ronald Reagan talked about the world uniting in the face of an alien attack from outer space, he was quoting John Dewey's 1917 speech wherein he praises a world state. Bill Clinton repeated the same statement about an alien invasion. In 1974, Richard Gardner wrote a book for the CFR entitled The Hard Road to World Order in which he writes, ""We are going to do an end-run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece."" September 11, 1991 George H. W. Bush gave the famous new world order speech. In 1993 George Soros wrote an essay entitled Toward a New World Order. Bill Clinton referenced George H. W. Bush when asserting that we need a new world order. The CFR, which was focused on eugenics at its inception uses the term international order as did Barack Obama. More recently it has been marketed as the liberal world order.

Also, check out Article 29 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, part 3 to understand what they truly mean by ""rights.""",ASTOFreedom,2,2024-12-08 19:13:07,new world order,0.029772727272727267,RussianDawg27

Though my late response will likely guarantee its obscurity, I feel that both the topic and OP's interpretation thereof merits the effort of continued dialogue.


I'm honestly relieved that others are reaching a conclusion that, to me, seems blatantly obvious. It takes very little effort and minimal objectivity, to recognize the elements of Trump's true globalist agenda. While there were measures taken to conceal this objective behind a facade of national reprioritization, the underlying machinations are still visible with only a passing glance. The map presented here being but one example.


Though the final UN partitioning of the world will still include America as a quasi-political entity, it will NOT exist as a superpower, not by any metric or definition. Instead, all that will ultimately remain of the once-mighty United States will be a heavily lacquered, highly polished corpse. And, as incredulous as it surely seems, this outcome is precisely as intended by the architects of the Great American Experiment, those history refers to as Founding Fathers.

without covid and the lockdown, it would have likely been MUCH harder to literally make hundreds of thousands of ""mail-in"" ballots  magically flood into select precints in those states where the race was tight.... and what a weird coincidence that  just enough votes turned up out of thin air to make up for the deficit and flip those final results to a slim Biden win, when they were all leaning Trump with something like 98% of precints reporting in before 1am when suddenly Biden ballots materialized from the ether

which isn't to say there's not massive fraud in EVERY election, just like there is in every other aspect of America lol from the economy to the ""justice"" system  and everything in between. 

if you need proof, literally open your eyes and use 4th grade internet ability to find and watch the countless videos of blatant law breaking lol just because the mainstream media tells us ""there's no proof of fraud"" doesn't mean you can't find literal thousands of instances without much effort

 fraud of every variety which almost definitely benefited the one side with seemingly much less organic support to overcome a sizeable deficit in the dead of night. Yanno, like all the videos of poll workers suspiciously covering every possible area where someone outside might take a peek at what's happening inside right as poll workers get the boot so the poll workers could close up shop for the night. 

or watch the countless videos of poll workers, mailmen or other govt officials throwing out ballots, ripping up or shredding ballots, even lighting ballots on fire while they record themselves giggling as they monologue on how awful X canidate is. 

just the simple fact that a state like California legally prevents a voter from even voluntarily showing ID to vote SCREAMS massive fraud - as Joe Rogan said about 100 times during his podcasts last week... what other reason is there to not require identification? other than making cheating possible. 

the entire election ""your vote counts!"" gimmick is complete theater to begin with imo. the real rulers of our reality would NEVER leave it up to chance, even if the US President is merely a puppet they control. this cycle made it super obvious that the canidates are selected for us and they always just happen to align on all the REAL major issues (support Israel, support Ukraine, don't talk about elite/govt child trafficking, don't legitimately investigate obvious criminals who've been in govt positions for 5 or 6 decades straight, or alternate between govt official and employee of the industries they were just in charge of regulating) - just like when Trump last won, instead of ""drain the swamp"" he immediately filled his Cabinet with mushbrain psychopaths from the Obama, Clinton and Bush administrations (HE LITERALLY HIRED JOHN BOLTON FOR GOODNESS SAKE!) or how Trump shamelessly pushed the mRNA gene therapy under a ""vaccine"" costume and TO THIS DAY has yet to admit the vaccine is 100% bullshit and deadly, even lying to us that he was completely manipulated and had NO idea (yeahhhh, right.)

Anyone with a brain who's lived through multiple administrations can plainly see... despite all the campaigning bullshit the candidates spin endlessly.... nothing critical EVER changes. Clinton, Bush and Obama all just coincidentally waged the same wars against the same ""axis of evil"" - Iraq, Syria, Libya, Aghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Yemen, etc. Even mr. ""no new wars!"" Trump didn't utilize the power he had to immediately cease our drug smuggling or whatever the point of Afghanistan was. No one ever audits the Government's spending or dares even utter anything about the Federal Reserve or our debt-slavery economy. Trump threatened NATO and the UN so they'd cover their fair share..... and didn't utter a single peep about the creepy way we endlessly do Israel's bidding like a do-boy or. No President from either party ever bothers to look into why so many ""public servants"" on limited salaries somehow manage to increase their net worth 10-50x while ""serving"" in Congress or other high lvl positions. Shit, not a single peep about Epstein or all the psychotic, LITERAL EVIL, anti-humanity activities carried out in secret by our intelligence agencies, including regularly breaking the law to target Americans in America.



this election was more one-sided, but if elections were 100% legit...why don't we EVER see a *true* landslide? How has California never voted 60/40 in favor of a Demonrat? Why doesn't Florida or Texas, red to the core, ever vote Republican 5 or 10 to 1? Just like polling for the last year.... they always seem to coincidentally wind up with merely 1-5 points difference... seriously? ALWAYS? EVERY. SINGLE. POLL? 

As the internet has taught us, many times people voting for a thing will hive-mind support the ironic or meme option in overwhelming numbers.... yet it never happens in US elections? Why haven't we had a dominating write-in victory by Ass-y McShitTits or something else 4chan-y? 

If any of this actually mattered, the elites ruling over us would NEVER even give us an opportunity to potentially throw them a curve ball. Out of the literal tens of millions of Americans that could end up running for President throughout America's history.... how does ONE family tree just magically happen to produce almost every single elected President...? Even more strange, the vast majority of (western) world leaders all just magically branch off the same family tree? So many of them literally groomed for their position of power since childhood.... I'm sure there's nothing to say that should be a statistical impossibility..

Trump is sooooo ""outside the system"" and a ""rogue populist"" who does what the people want...! Like... pardon Julian Assange...? Or idk, even something so painfully obvious and simple like say.... firing Fauci when he was blatantly lying and propaghandizing ad-nausem during his daily covid pressers, while pushing a literal mRNA gene therapy that ALTERS YOUR DNA and was NEVER tested on human beings and in ALL animal testing, the shots had catastrophic results?

Or idk.... you're only the PRESIDENT... I'm sure there's literally nothing Trump could have done to prevent tyrannical state leaders from using the full extent of their power to punish evil terroristic Americans for daring to *gasp* walk their dog outside, totally alone? THANKS FOR KILLING GRANDMA YOU SELFISH PRICK! Meanwhile those same tyrants were caught repeatedly literally laughing and making fun of us for obeying the same foolish rules they never followed. 

We knew exactly what covid was from the word GO - Alex Jones, love or hate him, literally gave the game plan before the first peep about ""corona virus"" appeared in America... and the pandemic followed that script to the letter.... at any point, if nothing else, Trump could have gotten in front of a live mic and explained the same things Alex Jones did, taken directly from the papers and speeches of the very same demons carrying out the pandemic. 

If you have to pick trash or garbage, I guess Trump is the best of the most terrible options.... but you're only foolin yourself if you think things will truly change or improve, he may take us down a different route... but you can bet your ass we'll end up in the exact same place Kamala or Biden or any other puppet will take us. 

Trump isn't going to tear apart the CIA or FBI down to the framework, he isn't going to thoroughly investigate our many corrupt politicans, he isn't going to 100% end Ukraine and Israel ""aide"" ASAP and he isn't going anywhere near our debt based banking system, the FED or the many shadowy wealthy dynasties that have controlled society from the shadows for literal centuries at this point.





But hey! At least with Trump, things will certainly be infinitely more entertaining while we're racing down the dead end tracks on our way to WW3 or some other catastrophe the elites seemingly anticipate happening at some point between 2025-2030, for which they're actively preparing for and not uttering a single word of warning to the plebian masses (which would help explain why the *Deagle Report* estimated the US and all Western nations populations suddenly dropping by ~70 percent without any explanation next year - https://seemorerocks.substack.com/p/is-the-deagel-reports-2025-depopulation )

[Doctor Stephen D. Mumford,](http://population-security.org/mumford_bio.html) wrote in American democracy & the Vatican: Population Growth & national security, pg 172:

""The CIA serves as an agency through which secret assistance to the Holy Mother Roman Catholic Church can be provided by secret American society members acting as her defenders.

For creating the Office of Strategic Services [OSS], the wartime predecessor to the CIA, and this special arrangement with the Vatican, General William (Wild Bill) Donovan was decorated in July 1944 by Pope Pius XII with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Sylvester, the oldest and most prestigious of papal knighthoods. This award has been given to only one hundred other men in history, who by feat of arms or writing or outstanding deeds have spread the faith and have safeguarded and championed the Roman Catholic Church.

Donovan did more to safeguard and champion the Roman Catholic Church than any other American, and he was rewarded for his services with the highest Roman Catholic award ever received by an American. No doubt, thousands of others have striven with their deeds for similar recognition.""

Former CIA officer E. Howard Hunt said in an interview in the documentary ""A Coup Made in America"" which aired on Canadian television series Turning Points of History in 1998, speaking on his role in the coup d’état in Guatemala in 1954 that:

[“We had gotten the okay from Cardinal Spellman to go ahead with this… and I wouldn't presume to trace the lines of authority within the Catholic Church… how they get their information they deal with… We've always said in an admiring way that the Jesuits form the greatest intelligence service in the world and always have.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtjTBOeAVas&t=104s)



There was a time in which the people of the US and the other protestant nations saw the Catholic Church as an enemy due to the danger of the Jesuits, but this changed, all the more after the masonic revolutions. [There's been many figures pointing out their influence over it,](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qqmfgm/jesuit_control_over_freemasonry_admitted_by_many/) with those movements, the people moved away from the [materialist nationalism taught by the Bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic7ATn1zKPM) and started accepting the deranged metaphysics of the Catholic Church, which is strictly forbidden by the Bible itself. Even Napoleon himself greatly feared the Jesuits:


“The Jesuits are a military organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man.”

- Napoleon Bonaparte.

Now play that out in high voter counties across the country and you get exactly what we saw on election night & the following day.

Not a mystery, nor a surprise whatsoever to people who understand how ballot reporting works, which is why all the lawsuits went exactly nowhere.

Almost like a Puppet and if they fall out of line, they'll expose them therefore it's a united front and the overall agenda gets passed through all.

or 

Is it that those who are at the top are just so power hungry that they do these things (like sex with minors and eating people) as a means to just drench themselves in this apex of power move that only the sickest and dirtiest humans would ever do. and just to put them over the top, they get away with it and all partake together, getting away with the deed... so sick, so manipulative, and outragously devious that, to them, it's the most extreme thing possible and the biggest power move.

Highly intelligent psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. They often are also very charismatic and manipulative. Perfect recipe for positions of authority, especially politics. I would also say that many child abusers are probably psychopaths, not necessarily attracted to children, but children just happen to be the most vulnerable, and that's attractive to the psychopath.

There's also this theory, which I find extremely interesting.

* **Kakistocracy**

“One of the reasons for the intimate association of the power elite with child abuse is that they might use it to maintain their, somewhat hidden, ‘kakistocracy’: government by the worst and most evil people: a highly capable brand of psychopaths if you like.

Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally deep and pervasive understanding leads to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what that the kakistocracy needs: it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.

Enter child abuse. By abusing children you “give” them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child’s world changes from a world of opportunities, to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats and in doing so giving their autonomy away for life. And they might even carry it over to their children: stultifying their growth towards autonomy. Aristocrats and priests must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with a normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.

Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning, and completely ruthless psychopaths. Only a small fraction of the population (say 1%) is psychopath and as such has the benefit of an absence of empathy and a conscience: psychopaths are able to exploit others as if they were tools. Yet the vast majority of them are not particularly evil: they can be ruthless, daring, and callous, but they find mostly norm-abiding ways to be psychopathic: they might be mountaineers, military, ER-doctors, car or insurance salesmen, real-estate brokers, or white-collar criminals. But most are definitely not the high functioning individuals that compare with how the power elite sees themselves, and would accept as their peers. So how do you recruit suitable psychopaths in your midst if they do not advertise themselves as such?

Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completly ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they prove themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while, they become fully accepted a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain the system that gave them so many opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).

I think that what I have sketched above is a useful framework to understand the dynamics of elite child abuse networks. It is never an incident, it is “just” the kakistocracy maintaining and reinvigorating itself: business as usual. But the few moments the abuse networks become exposed it provides and ideal opportunity to glimpse the kakistocracy at work (and frantically protecting itself).”

This pizzagate conspiracy goes so deep and so many people at high level are involved that for a President or whoever to really go after it they'd have to basically declare war against the government. How many people are willing to get JFK'ed over this issue?

Watch mouthy Buddha's series on this topic. Again he does very good research. He was banned off YouTube before the era of covid.

Edit: forgot bit*hute is banned. And reddit pretends they are anti fascist. What a joke.

He resigned from overstock.com in 2019, but is still the company's largest shareholder.  He's a big promoter of conspiracy theories and I'm sure starting rumors that the competition are sex traffickers would be right up his alley.  From wikipedia:

Patrick Michael Byrne (born 1962) is an American businessman. In 1999, Byrne launched Overstock.com after leading two smaller companies. Byrne led Overstock as chief executive officer for two decades, from 1999 to 2019. In 2002, Byrne took Overstock public. Early in his tenure he attracted public attention for a long-running legal battle against short sellers and ""naked short selling."" He eventually resigned as CEO in August 2019, following revelations that he had been in an intimate relationship with Russian spy, and future politician with Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, Maria Butina.

Byrne then emerged as a leading figure in promoting conspiracy theories, including the ""Deep State"" conspiracy theory. In 2020 and 2021, he repeatedly promoted false claims that Donald Trump won the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to voter fraud, even though Trump was defeated in an election that was found to be the most secure in United States history. He has also toured the United States in order to provide anti-vaccination stump speeches for COVID-19 conspiracy theorists. He became notable for distributing and selling misinformation on various subject matters via websites, social media, books, and film. He has also been noted for his conservative views on public education.",notreallyswiss,3,2021-10-22 14:32:50,pizzagate,0.047495894909688016,AgentLead_TTV

So is Pepperidge Farms lying to us or do they have a bad memory? Trump had one year of prosecutions that were \~12% higher than Obama's max and then dropped for three years consecutively after. The first year of higher prosecutions was probably because he hadn't yet stripped those offices of their educated, active, interested personnel and the consecutive drops were due to Trump having finally hindered their efforts.  


  
I can only imagine how lucky Trump felt when he found out someone called ""Q-Anon"" was making up POSITIVE fantasies about him for a change.

But it's not though. It's a very elaborate and detailed set of accusations targeting very specific people. Honestly, I think it's obvious rich people get away with sex trafficking.

The problem is that politicians on average, even congressional ones, aren't even really in the top 5 percentile of the wealthiest people in the US.

Conspiracy,"Why people freaked out about ""Pizzagate"". Four businesses on Connecticut Ave. in DC had pedophilia symbols in their logos, including Comet Ping Pong. It has always been real.",2846,"Alefantis also had a secret ""art museum"" that was across from either a playground or an actual school. When this place was exposed. He flipped out and threatened the investigator in multiple messages on Facebook. 

Also the fact that they laugh and say there's no basement and yet articles from the time refrence them making and storing sauce in their basement. Then the ridiculous false flag shooter who succeeded in shooting nothing besides their computer ""destroying the hard drive"".

There was so much more sketchy evidence but I blocked out so much of it since pizzagate really fucked with my ptsd due to being molested. I was completely over it but pizzagate brought up those horrible feelings of powerlessness. Then paranoid people muddied the waters with all the Satanism and adrenochrome/Magick talk where it destroyed the legitimacy of the obvious trafficking ring. So I completely disconnected for my mental health

The bands they had preform were widely innapropriate. There was one with clear child abuse imagery(the one with the woman in the ski mask and voice changer). There was references fo the DC tunnels and underground ""shows"" there. There was just so much circumstantial but obvious evidence. Alefantis and friends had grotesque highly sexual images on their Instagram next to children. They even had a photo of a girl and called her something like a little slut. The hyperfixation on babies and toddlers was weird and unnatural. Preteens and teens are always there for ping-pong yet there was barely images of them since these guys obviously liked them young. 

Then there was alefantis having the Roman Antinous as his profile picture which is a worldwide symbol of gay pedarasts and man/by love. He was a teen lover of the emperor hadiran and is revered as an idol by pedarasts and predatory gay men who like teen twinks. Then there was the woman in the emails claiming to have her kids there(mentioning their ages specifically) for ""entertainment"" at the pool. She also had a website straight up advertising the kids for ""events"" then theres pedestal disgusting paintings that are in no way ""art"". Then there's their established relationships with multiple pedos like clement Freud. If the pizza and hotdogs weren't slang for kids they were slang for some heavy drugs or something . Either way when there's smoke there's fire and the level of collusion to totally drop this story is insanely sketchy. It was like the proto-hunter laptop. Reddit, facebook, youtube all collided to shut them down. Infact youtube cracked down on thousands of conspiracy videos as a guise to take down pizzagate. Shills from all corner started defending this behavior and the echochamber reddit leftists just spouted propaganda because they're so tribalist they'll knowing spread disinfo to not have to question members of their tribe. Share blue and media matters went hard against this. Also the head of media matters dated alefantis so there's that. 

If you look into alefantis(what isn't scrubbed) it's clear to see he's no ordinary ""pizza shop owner"". The level of which he is entwined with the DC elite heavily implied he ""supplies"" another service. His connections are insane and he was even listed in a list of the most influential people in D.C. His history and where he made his millions to buy like 5 businesses is unknown, yet he didn't come from a prominent family. He's extremely sketchy and is some sort of asset to have such deep public ties as a fucking pizza store owner. That makes no sense. Also pizza shops have a long history of being used to launder money. Hell my grandpa was mobbed up and involved in gambling rackets and they'd launder through pizza and bakeries. Like 75% of all heroin money in NYC from 70-90s were laundered this way, see the pizza connection documentary. 

But want to hear the grossest part? James alefantes is not his birth name. Why would he pick such a name? And then have a profile picture of a man boy love symbol in Antinous. Well what's ""I like children"" in French? j'aime les enfants. What's the odds of that? That a man who has a fixation with kids, posts pictures of them, calling them sluts, admist sexual images, has a profile picture of a international man boy love symbol, has pedophile symbols on his businesses, just so happens to pick the alias of ""James alefantes"" which is pronounced almost exactly like j'aime les enfants. This is how they hide in plain site yet are able to find each other. A pedophile seeing that name next to an antinous picture would instantly know he's ""one of them"". Seriously what are the odds that his name just happens to be James alefantes, he posts kids pictures, opens a kid oriented store, has crazy sexual imagery, idolized a symbol of man boy love. And ontop of all that his connections screams that he provides some other service. Not even the best chefs of our generation have the political connections this man has. It seems quite obvious that he's an asset of intelligence/deep state like epstein and he's running his own ring. Which explains the instant and intense media and social media collusion to cover up a story about some random pizza store owner. It explains his connections, his name, his buisiness, his owning multiple sketchy businesses. When there's smoke there's fire and it's an inferno.

The real sketchy thing is his ""Pegasus museum"" it's a very sketchy building, right behind a playground. He's had no official art shows there, it's heavily industrial, he posted pictures of them digging tunnels there and doing massive construction(also posted about a ""kill room"") and he freaked the fuck out on a youtuber for finding it. The threats he sent him were absolutely insane and dude comes off as unhinged. He did nor act this way during any of the exposure of comet ping pong or bucks. Yet he was legit scared and frantic when the Pegasus museum was found. There's something there. That's where the bad shit goes down and is where the center of any investigation should be concentrated on. 

Sure I feel pizzagate was heavily muddied by bots and bad actors trying to make it seem like some loony schizo conspiracy. I don't believe much of the Satanism stuff. But there's definitely something going on and it revolves around kids and pedophilia. Dudes obviously into kids and has done everything but say I from chosing his name, revering antinous, and his fixation on children. And it seems he's some weird deep state honeypot or child supplier due to his vast connections, mysterious fortune far exceeding any small buisiness owner, and the media's quick collusion to kill the story as soon as it popped up. 

And almost immediately afterwards the qanon psyop popped up that tried to paint all conspiracy theorists as schizo and all child trafficking as some satanic panic myth. When in reality its the sick reality of our world. Fuck or kill a kid on video then they have blackmail on you and you can join their gang with them comfortably knowing you'd never whistle blow or else your own crimes will be revealed. It's also conditioning to destroy any shred of innocence and respect for human life. It establishes you as part of the gang and the rest as soulless peasants unworthy of respect. It feeds absolute power complexes where the elite has the ultimate say over the lives of millions of people. Which is why our elites have no issues sending young men to die for profit, approving false flags of murder, running murderous medical experiments,  and viewing American deaths as mere statistics and not people. Stuff like MK ultra shows this true side of the elite. They respect normal people so little where they literally want to forcibly control their minds through massive trauma and drugs. They believe we don't even deserve sovereignty of our own thought. Genuinely good people are either railroaded out of politics or get a Clinton special to the back of the head. The few that slip through are forced into these disgusting child abuse rituals, they know it's the ultimate crime to destroy a child's innocence, so once a good man does he's broken and completely controllable. You will be much more willing to kill adult Americans through corrupt policies or go to any length to maintain power if you already killed a child. And it makes sure everyone plays ball and works to keep their system of power alive.",Poop_Cheese,757,2022-07-24 18:08:52,pizzagate,-0.022368701395547048,destinythrowaway10

The shooter shot into a closet, thinking it was a door leading to the nonexistent basement. Instead, he hit the computer in the closet, but there's no evidence that he hit the hard drive. That bit was made up by the internet stalkers.

If Alefantis had wanted to destroy the hard drive, he could have just hit with a hammer and thrown it in the trash. He was never under investigation. It makes no sense that someone would arrange a shooter to dispose of it.

If people actually believed that children were being held captive in Comet Ping Pong's basement, then they would have treated the shooter as a hero. Instead, he's reviled as part of a plot. This convinced me that nobody actually believes the shit about Comet Ping Pong.

His birth names is James Alefantis. His father's name is Achilles Louis Alefantis. His grandfather's name was Louis George Alefantis. This was all researched back in November 2016. By the way, ""James Alefantis"" and ""j'aime les enfants"" don't sound alike.

> The real sketchy thing is his ""Pegasus museum"" it's a very sketchy building, right behind a playground. He's had no official art shows there, it's heavily industrial, he posted pictures of them digging tunnels there and doing massive construction(also posted about a ""kill room"") and he freaked the fuck out on a youtuber for finding it. 

> he posted pictures of them digging tunnels there and doing massive construction

Yes, there were two pictures ([one](https://i.imgur.com/LMR7hEx.png), [two](https://i.imgur.com/ljBh1Iz.png)) that had pictures of construction. These ""tunnels"" look like the trenches people use for plumbing and sewer lines. There's nothing remotely suspicious about renovating a building. It's done all the time. Maybe they were planning on turning the building into ... a museum?

Those pictures, by the way, were the reason people thought there was a basement with ""tunnels"" under Comet Ping Pong. The internet stalkers *assumed* that these pictures were taken *at* Comet Ping Pong and they noticed the lack of any construction permits for Comet. Therefore, they deduced, these were *secret* tunnels being dug for nefarious purposes like abusing children or —I'm not making this up— connecting to a network of secret tunnels under Washington that was used for transporting abducted children. Besides the pictures, there was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo), which the internet stalkers claimed that they could hear children screaming for help from the basement, even though nobody in the video seems to hear anything unusual.


> (also posted about a ""kill room"")

Alefantis posted a [picture of walk-in cooler](https://i.imgur.com/Cl3TuvM.png), which was at a restaurant Alefantis was thinking of buying. Somebody made a joke about ""#killroom"", which is evidently a reference to the TV show Dexter.

So what? Do you think people are actually plotting a murder on Instagram? Or is somebody making a joke?

> and he freaked the fuck out on a youtuber for finding it. 

Yes, this was *after* the gunman had attacked Comet Ping Pong. Hmmmmm ... I wonder why Alefantis would not want internet stalkers directed to another location? I just can't figure that one out.",BaronOfSheepCastle,-4,2022-07-24 18:08:52,pizzagate,-0.07344224924012158,Poop_Cheese

It was children being farmed in underground cities for sex slaves and they adrenalyn glands. It was hillary clinton wearing the face that was cut off a child.

If Trump is involved in the crimes against children, and these elite pedo rings, then I am all for his arrest and prosecution. However, it does not appear he is. He has called this ""cabal"" out multiple times in public, but people just don't pay attention closely enough.

Additionally, the prosecutor who nailed Epstein on his original pedophilia charges in Florida said Trump was the only witness who was completely forthcoming.
