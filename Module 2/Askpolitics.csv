Askpolitics,Is QAnon still a thing?,1,"""Q"" of QAnon stopped posting drops in December of 2020. He/they/it came back for three more posts in June of 2022 but nothing since then. Q has been pretty thoroughly unmasked as being Ron and Jim Watkins.

QAnon is still definitely a thing though it's more diffuse than it used to be. There's people in just these more ""pilled"" circles that have clung onto issues that are resonant to them specifically. You had people like Michael Protzman (Negative 48,) Dave Hayes (Praying Medic,) and Kerry Cassidy (Project Camelot) who grew their audiences massively off QAnon stuff as well as people like Jacob Chansley (QAnon Shaman) but for the most part most people have kinda gone their separate ways down other avenues of grift that are more fruitful at the moment.

QAnon never was super coherent but it was definitely a binding force that held disparate parts of the conspiracy space together that otherwise may not have interacted. That is still kind of there but more as an in-group signifier rather than a common cause.

It also doesn't help that superspreaders like Alex Jones have moved on to other things.

There's still a bunch of accounts that try to just do the Q thing again on various social media platforms but none of them have actually caught on.",HeloRising,21,2024-10-25 11:52:08,QAnon,0.18309178743961355,Just_passing_by_67

Askpolitics,Is QAnon still a thing?,1,"Unfortunately the reality of the situation is not that clear.

There's different levels of buy-in with respect to the panoply of conspiracy theories that broadly make up the QAnon umbrella.

It's *really* important to understand that virtually everyone, including you, probably believes at least one conspiracy theory to be true. That's not unusual or rare at all.  Virtually everyone also has what we might call ""fence"" beliefs about conspiracy theories - theories that they're not completely convinced are true but are also not convinced that they're *untrue.* Like you can't *prove* it for a fact but you have a deep feeling that it's *probably* true.

This describes the vast majority of QAnon adherents. QAnon beliefs are such that it's generally not possible to believe in the whole thing wholeheartedly because, if you did, you probably wouldn't be a functioning member of society. That kind of belief structure would drive you absolutely mad. 

That extends to people who have that kind of buy-in for various aspects of QAnon beliefs and those are the people.

You don't want to push those people too far away because there's nowhere else for them to go except these more extreme beliefs and once they're in that space it's very, very hard to get them out again.

It's true that there's a certain subset that value the feeling of knowing more than being attached to a consensus view of reality but there's nothing to really do for that, they're going to do that no matter what. But there's still plenty of people that don't need to be pushed into these extreme circles and by labeling any Republican as a QAnon person that's what's being done.

It makes them more curious to QAnon type things and that breadcrumb trail inevitably leads them to Negative 48 type stuff once they get into these spaces. That's the path a lot of hardcore QAnon people went down.",HeloRising,1,2024-10-25 11:52:08,QAnon,0.08334467120181407,Substantial-Prune704

Askpolitics,what is qanon? Where did it start? What are the actual beliefs of the members? And do we have any idea who started it?,0,"Phew, long story for this one.



So basically on the pol board on 4 Chan, a guy showed up claiming he had Q clearance (basically a top secret clearance for government specifically.


People on 4chan are called “anons” so that’s where “qanon” came from.


It started with saying that trump was fighting the secret vampire pedophile cabal cult, that’s why people didn’t like them, and that was why Hillary Clinton was going to get arrested in 2 weeks.


Of course, that didn’t happen.

Or they also all believe there’s a video where Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin murdering a child, drinking her blood and taking turns wearing the skin from her face as a mask


That also didn’t happen.


The most popular one is “pizzagate”, where they
Believed a pizza restaurant was selling the kids to the democrats out of their basement, which resulted in qanon lads showing up and trueing to violently break in and see the basement.


The building… didn’t have a basement.


So that’s the what is, and where did it start; the actual belief of the members starts to get weird.



For example, most of the “theories” of how the democrats rigged the election in 2020 came from qanon.


About 70% of republicans believe democrat politicians are in a pedophilic sex cult for instance; this is also  qanon.


This is my bias, but most republicans hold at least one or two of the conspiracy theories as gospel.

Askpolitics,What is the Deep State?,5,"It’s not really that simple. Most civil servants work in the specific area that they have a background in and want funding for that area because they think it is important and because they’re continued employment depends on their being funds. Generally, Republicans run on reducing funding and Democrats do not, so over all, most federal employees vote Democrat. However, both Republican and Democratic administrations have different priorities, and so different agencies can have different relationships with presidents who share a party. For instance, the NEH which funds the a lot of the nation’s museums, battlefields, cultural heritage preservation, etc was very popular with the Bush administration, and Trump tried to zero out their budget every year he was in office, and every year congressional republicans fought to not only keep but increase their budget, because a lot of what they do is important to Republican constituents in their home districts. Another complication is that Defense and the Justice Department rank and file are overwhelmingly Republican, and probably account for 95% of Republican voters in Northern Virginia, but the Trump administration has beef with them too, and is usually talking about them when talking about the deep state. This is in part because Trump was actively investigated by the intelligence agencies during his first term, and in part because it is sexier, flashier stuff than like keeping track of chemicals in the water supply work that a lot of government employees do, and lends itself to wilder conspiracy theories, when your average bureaucrat move against an agenda they don’t agree with is just to unfold it very slowly and hope the guy is out of office before it comes to fruition, which is significantly more boring",Chemical_Estate6488,2,2024-11-26 18:13:49,deep state,0.04819444444444445,JGCities

But even then, there are horror stories when the bishops make bad rulings. It cannot scale up. It always begins as a grassroots movement of individuals, but if it collects to critical mass, authoritarianism happens. Russia, to North Korea, to Cuba, they are all examples of it hitting critical mass.

I have considered it. I give eggs and other produce to my neighbors, free of charge, just to be a good neighbor. To build good relations with them.  I also charge people money for my eggs. I also trade eggs for credit at the local roadside produce stand and walk away with produce.

But the foundation of my complaint is, granting others power over my production rate, input on my production processes, command of my distribution, this is authoritarianism over me, locally. When you regulate me, your justification is I'm harboring moral turpitude. And I then have to submit to your judgement or face consequences. I don't harbor that. It would be a lie to admit to it. It's oppressive to make me.

At the core of the appeal to communism, you're telling me I'm required to trust someone else to care for me and mine like I do. I don't. Thats the crux of the problem here.

I voted for Trump because it's short term holding off that nightmare. It's absolutely coming eventually. I won't be his first target. Again, the left is unreasonable. They are not introspective. They can't self-reflect, self correct, admit when they got something wrong. Their character is such that it does not build trust.

Republicans complained about election fraud. The left denied it. There are thousands of examples of what we called a perversion of justice. Ignored. Double standards and sweet-heart deals for special interests. If the left actually cared about the right, they'd pause, they seriously consider what the right has said. They'd investigate and make sure they and their departments handled it even handedly. But not so much as a gesture. Every time someone goes against the left narrative, they get very publicly flogged and excommunicated. And we on the right are watching and listening.

Example:

A presidential candidate’s son loses a laptop full of damning information. Just a few weeks before the election, the information on that laptop is made public, harming the reputation of the candidate and risking his presidency. 

After the release of the information, 50 intelligence officers sign a letter stating that the laptop is Russian disinformation in an attempt to remove its credibility. Then, social media reduces or outright prevents the circulation of a NY Post article about the info on this laptop in an attempt to put a halt to the story. 

I consider the actions by the 50 intelligence officers and the social media companies to be clear cases of election fraud. How severe of election fraud? I don’t know. How influential was it in the upcoming election? I also don’t know.

Voters need to be ID'd and then marked somehow (indelable ink on hand, and digitally marked off by ID.) At their polling place to ensure 1 vote one voter.

All verifiable election or voter fraud should be considered treason and punishable by death penalty. Anyone attempting to prevent someone from voting at their polling place is immediately arrested and charged with same.

Anyone who turns someone else in for solid proof of election fraud recieves 1Million USD upon conviction.

Askpolitics,What evidence would it take for you to believe or accept that our election process has been compromised?,93,">No. They are probably not correct in their understanding. They are so entrenched in the partisan battle that they believe things that aren't true.

The conversation has never been about whether there were *any* instances of voter fraud, it has always been about *outcome-determinative* voter fraud. So, if someone says they don't believe there was *voter fraud*, they are typically responding to the Republican claims that the election was rigged. This implies the *outcome-determinative* aspect, even if the person is not articulating themselves to that level of precision. This position is inherently more correct, even if a person comes to the conclusion through some type of partisan media consumption.

Sure, there may be a fringe minority people you have had conversations with who genuinely believe there was literally no election fraud, but I think these are rare cases. Certainly not Democrat politicians. Most will admit that, yes, there of course are real instances of voter fraud when they're pressed.

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1666,"From a social democrat perspective of what I’ve seen when people try to explain to them why trump should be disqualified. It’s all due to cognitive bias.

1) conservatives who believe don’t challenge their cognitive bias when they listen to the claim. This means any time you point out how he legitimately was attempting to overthrow the results an election they will go on a cognitive bias train:
He used fake slates of electors -> no they were just alternates
He admitted they were fake in court -> well ok but that was just there was election fraud
There was no fraud -> there was fraud I watched a propaganda film that says there was
That was all disproven in court -> the courts are biased
The judges were republicans and appointed by trump -> they are RINOS and paid off

It just goes on and on since they approach it from “trump is right” and they view the facts around how to excuse him instead of viewing the facts and deciding off them.

2) when you raise Jan 6 their cognitive bias prevents them from forming the logical conclusion that Jan 6 was the culmination of the attempt to overthrow the election.

Trump said at one point 20 minutes in “peaceful” one time. He spent the next 40 minutes telling them to fight for their country or they will lose it. Cognitive bias homes in on this one time he said peaceful and ignores the other 40 minutes of incitement.

It also ignores all the other points made about Trump telling them that Mike Pence failed to do what he did and them yelling “hang mike pence” based on that. I don’t properly understand how they cognitive bias this away, they tend to get caught up here.

3) they respond here with either 2 methods - they see it and think it’s worth the price of admission.
Or they see it and think that behaviour that would be disrespectful and distasteful for anyone else is funny because it represents rejection of politics as usual which has left them behind. Even if anyone else engaged in it they would think that - it’s all applied through the prism of the individual.

4) those who have become enamoured of trump allow him to shape their principles instead of holding to their principles. It’s why republicans pretend to anti-war when during the Iraq war they lambasted any suggestion of withdrawing from Iraq as “cutting and running”. 

So giving up supposed principles about small government is easy. For politicians this was always just a song and dance anyway - the national debt increased by $5 trillion under George bush.

5) large numbers of right wing people have a strongly authoritarian streak and so his outright embrace of fascism is a selling point to these people, not a disqualification.

6) for MAGA it doesn’t matter, cognitive bias. Those who oppose trump are RINOs or warmongers. This is why people on the left say the MAGAs are in a cult.

For the ones that it’s the price of admission they downplay it mentally, still cognitive bias but it’s justified away as “ but the policies…”.",Murranji,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,false flag,-0.0102813852813853,GeppettoCat

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1666,"Covid happened in Trump’s last year of office, when no one knew much about it or how to handle it.

Seems silly to blame him in retrospect for not handling it “correctly” when it was such an unknown.

Heck, people were still claiming the lab leak theory was “debunked” & “misinformation,” & we now know it was true.

Trump relied on his medical advisors, Fauci & Birx, which in retrospect was a mistake. However, the left GLORIFIED Fauci, so it seems hypocritical to bash Trump for his handling of COVID when he was relying on the alleged “science” of Fauci whom the left adored.

Sweden handled it best by not shutting things down, but in 2020 US democrats overwhelmingly bashed Sweden’s approach & pushed hard for severe lockdowns.

Trump rushed an mRNA vaccine, which was another mistake, but again liberals ended up worshipping the vaccine and demonizing anyone who wouldn’t take it. Indeed, the Biden regime then mandated the mRNA shots, at the cost of people’s careers & freedom of travel if they did not comply with the intrusion on their bodies.

So again, it is hypocritical for the left to years later claim Trump handled COVID poorly in the first year of the unprecedented virus.

As for Nikki Haley, she’s just another warmongering puppet for the establishment & military industrial complex.

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1666,"A few things I want to state more broadly as they are consistent in some other posts.  

1. I was wrong about the officer dying due to Jan. 6th injuries. He was hurt during the riot but his death shortly after was ruled natural causes. But officers were injured and that doesn't fit with my beliefs. I also do believe that if Trump hadn't spread the stolen election lie, then a bunch of patriotic people wouldn't have stormed the Capitol in the first place and all of those people would be alive. I believe Trump knows his impact on people and would be smart enough to know his rhetoric would have an impact. He may may not have known it would lead to storming the Capitol, but we often hold people accountable for unintended consequences (e.g. involuntary manslaughter), so I don't find holding him culpable to be a stretch.

2. I believe if Trump really wanted to solve problems and also help the republican party, he would have encouraged the congress republicans to vote yes on the immigration bill. This would have given many republican senators something else to run on and I would have seen that as a favorable action, refuting some of my beliefs about him, and may have swung my vote back in his favor. I would have at least considered it more so.

  
3. The economy keeps coming up. I think Trump will win and I think it will be about the economy. A lot of us have felt hardships during these past 4 years due to inflation. A lot of that inflation came from both Trump's stimulus and also Biden's expanded child tax credit. I have a hard time assigning blame for inflation entirely to either administration, especially since inflation was so bad globally. I do appreciate how when rates rose, we avoided a recession and kept employment near full employment - historically 4% - 4.3% is considered full employment by the Fed and LBS. I'm fortunate to not live on the margins and perhaps the limits to how inflation has or hasn't impacted me influences me differently. But as nation we've toughed out several recessions and we'll do it again. Both economic plans are said to add to the deficit, with Trump's adding more so. I did watch the entire interview he had with the Chicago Economic club but he didn't have any good answers as to how his plans wouldn't create the recession and debt forecasted. Instead he resulted to name calling, which, again, is a turn off for me. So for my remaining conservatives out there who have the economy in mind- I hear you and understand the choice you want to make there but I haven't seen anything credible there that would warrant moving past the concerns I expressed in my original post.",GeppettoCat,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,false flag,0.11593193843193846,GeppettoCat

Askpolitics,What is the Deep State?,3,"It’s not really that simple. Most civil servants work in the specific area that they have a background in and want funding for that area because they think it is important and because they’re continued employment depends on their being funds. Generally, Republicans run on reducing funding and Democrats do not, so over all, most federal employees vote Democrat. However, both Republican and Democratic administrations have different priorities, and so different agencies can have different relationships with presidents who share a party. For instance, the NEH which funds the a lot of the nation’s museums, battlefields, cultural heritage preservation, etc was very popular with the Bush administration, and Trump tried to zero out their budget every year he was in office, and every year congressional republicans fought to not only keep but increase their budget, because a lot of what they do is important to Republican constituents in their home districts. Another complication is that Defense and the Justice Department rank and file are overwhelmingly Republican, and probably account for 95% of Republican voters in Northern Virginia, but the Trump administration has beef with them too, and is usually talking about them when talking about the deep state. This is in part because Trump was actively investigated by the intelligence agencies during his first term, and in part because it is sexier, flashier stuff than like keeping track of chemicals in the water supply work that a lot of government employees do, and lends itself to wilder conspiracy theories, when your average bureaucrat move against an agenda they don’t agree with is just to unfold it very slowly and hope the guy is out of office before it comes to fruition, which is significantly more boring",Chemical_Estate6488,2,2024-11-26 18:13:49,new world order,0.04819444444444445,JGCities

Askpolitics,Why does anyone actually believe the 2020 election was stolen?,224,"Lots of reasons. The election was irregular in a large number of ways. In no particular order:

The vote had a very, very large turnout. Unusual turnout can be, but is not always, a sign of election fraud.

Trump lost despite having incumbent advantage. It's been a very long time since a sitting president seeking reelection lost it.

The timeline for the election was much longer than usual. Some states weren't called for over a week. This was due to mail in voting, and Americans, particularly older ones who've seen more elections, knew this was an unusually long time.

Donald Trump had an early lead in many battleground states when tallying stopped, and was quickly overtaken by Joe when it resumed. While possible, this is statistically very odd. I'm sure you've seen the F-Curve Graph.

Trump also won most ""bellweather"" counties. These are a selection of counties that, historically, tend to predict the winner of the presidency. This time, they did not.

There was also strangeness outside of the election itself. Biden was not a strong candidate. He mostly won the primary by other candidates dropping out and endorsing him, a move that seemed, at the time, to be a repeat of the 2016 cycle where the DNC maneuvered to block Bernie from the general ticket. Biden didn't magically become more popular after getting the nomination, and many Trump supporters thought this would translate to a repeat of that election.

The aftermath didn't do much to inspire confidence either. The Trump campaign filed legal challenges in many states, and so did I think Texas? Can't remember which but some state called into question another states loose procedure to the Supreme Court, stating that by leaving their elections open to fraud, they diminish the power of Texas(?) to have their votes matter. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and almost all of the Trump Campaign  legal cases were thrown out on standing. That is to say, rather than ruling on the merits of these cases, or even hearing them, the courts said ""you are not legally in a position to contest the procedures of the election you were just part of"". 

It was also strange to many that the political left responded the way they did to these accusations of cheating and fraud. After all, the last four years had been spent with people claiming that our elections were not secure and had been interfered with by the Russians. And other instances of cheating had been claimed back during the Bush presidency as well. But as soon as it went the other way we had the most secure voting system in history.

So yeah. A host of unaddressed irregularities and emotional investment combined into people thinking that there'd been cheating and fraud.",SE-MIreader,6,2024-10-22 16:13:23,stolen election,0.1455972938626,PlaneHungry7400

Askpolitics,Why does anyone actually believe the 2020 election was stolen?,224,"1. Unusual Voting Patterns
Example: Detroit, Michigan

Data: Precinct 134 in Detroit reported 2,001 votes cast but had only 1,382 registered voters.

Implication: This significant discrepancy suggests potential voting irregularities such as ballot stuffing or erroneous reporting.

2. Temporal Voting Discrepancies
Example: Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Data: Between 3:30 AM and 4:30 AM on November 4th, Milwaukee reported an influx of 169,000 votes, with 85% favoring Joe Biden. 

Implication: Such a sudden surge in votes deviates from typical voting patterns, indicating potential data dumps or late ballot injections.

3. Cross-County Voter Registration Issues
Example: Pennsylvania

Data: Approximately 7,426 individuals were registered in both Allegheny and Philadelphia counties, with records showing votes cast in both locations (Pennsylvania Statewide Voter Registration Database, 2020).

Implication: This points to possible voter fraud through double voting.

4. Ballot Rejection Rate Anomalies
Example: Georgia

Data: Fulton County had a 0.2% rejection rate for mail-in ballots, while Cobb County had a 4.5% rejection rate (Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 2020).
Implication: Such significant differences suggest inconsistent application of ballot acceptance criteria or other underlying issues.

5. Discrepancies in Vote Tabulation
Example: Clayton County, Georgia

Data: Initially, Clayton County reported 85,000 votes for Donald Trump, which changed to 81,000 in the final count (Clayton County Election Board, 2020).

Implication: This could indicate errors in counting, recounting, or intentional manipulation.

6. Redaction and Document Modifications
Example: Clark County, Nevada

Data: Documents detailing mail-in voting procedures were modified multiple times, with key sections heavily redacted just days before the election (Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2020).

Implication: Changes made close to the election date could create confusion or suggest attempts to manipulate processes.

7. Network Analysis of Covert Operations
Example: Arizona

Data: Graph analysis identified 300 accounts on Twitter posting similar messages about election fraud, all created within a week of each other (Twitter Analysis Report, 2020).
Implication: This could indicate coordinated misinformation campaigns.

8. Foreign Influence Correlation
Example: Pennsylvania

Data: Over 500 login attempts to Pennsylvania state election systems were traced back to IP addresses from Russia during critical voting periods (Pennsylvania Cybersecurity Report, 2020).
Implication: Potential foreign interference in election processes.
9. Geospatial Anomalies
Example: Rural Wisconsin

Data: Rural District 7 reported a 95% voter turnout, while neighboring districts had turnout rates around 60% (Wisconsin Election Data Analysis, 2020).

Implication: Unusual turnout rates could suggest organized efforts to influence results in specific areas.

10. Temporal Patterns in Document Releases
Example: Michigan

Data: A series of documents detailing potential election vulnerabilities were released by the Michigan Secretary of State's office just days before the election (Michigan Secretary of State, 2020).
Implication: The timing of such releases could be strategic, aiming to sway public opinion or affect voter confidence.

Conclusion
The detection of these anomalies underscores the urgent need for continuous and comprehensive monitoring of election processes to ensure their integrity and the public's trust. The advanced methodologies employed in this analysis reveal significant irregularities that warrant further investigation. These anomalies potentially impact between 250,000 to 1,200,000 votes, a range that could significantly influence election outcomes in key states.

Askpolitics,Why does anyone actually believe the 2020 election was stolen?,224,"I have an uncle. He is not prone to lying, but he believes the election could have been fraudulent. I’ve tried to break through to him, and in that experience, I think I can hit on the answer to your question. 

He believes what he believes because he trusts his sources. They validate his biases, and they tell him that any contrary view is uninformed at best, or maliciously false at worst. This is anything from a media report speaking negatively about Trump, to Covid protections, to democrats inviting illegal aliens in. They tell him these things, give him comfort and validation for his beliefs, and create enemies of anyone who would say otherwise. 

They have been doing this to him over many years. From Obama’s birth certificate to Hillary’s emails, through the Biden crime family. He believes his sources because he CAN’T believe any others. They are just too evil, and since his side is fighting the evil, they must be the ones telling the truth. 

It doesn’t go beyond that. I can try to talk facts, reason, and evidence but he just casually ignores everything he can’t spin away. A good example is that he likes to post how Democrats were the party of slavery, and use that to compare the party today. I have told him numerous times, with details and sourcing, about how the white southern conservative democrats disliked the party’s growing support for civil rights, and they splintered off. I can show him information on Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats. And I can show him the Southern Strategy, where the Republican Party worked to court those new voters by engaging on religious grounds and giving plenty of leeway for the more bigoted ideals of that group. I’ve shown him how that group has gradually gained power within the party, until today they are one of the most prominent GOP voting bases. I can tell him all of this with detail and sourcing, and he pretends he didn’t see it. The next day, it’s back to “Democrats are the party of slavery”. 

He doesn’t care about facts or reality. It’s his side (the heroes) vs those who want to destroy everything he values. The enemy can’t be telling the truth, so his media must be. Even if the facts don’t align. It doesn’t matter.

You have to go back to Geroge HW Bush.  Who lost to Clinton.  Before that, you had to go back ...8 **whole** years to when Reagan beat Carter.  Before that, you had to go back **4 whole years** when Carter beat Ford.  So while it hasn't happened in the last three cycles of Obama, Bush, Clinton, it's not like it's unheard of in the last 50 years. (And lets not forget that Gore (the incumbent VP) only lost to Bush due to the Supreme Court claiming injury if the recount of votes in Florida took place, ending the recount which ultimately was found that Gore had the most votes.  Bush won his incumbent election due to 9/11 and being in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by the time of the election.

Elections take time if you have limited resources to manage the election if in places like Red stated, they consistently underfund election resources.  Additional, there was a pandemic going on, so yes lots more mail in ballots.  Which have to be managed and verified **after** the count of the in-person voter ballots are tabulated.  Otherwise it would be a waste of resources, according to those that establish the laws around absentee ballots.  It also doesn't help when you have attorneys and court cases working to stop counts, stop recounts, appeal to the next level, etc.  **Georgia**, a Republican controlled state was requiring a **human** hand count of ballots until a judge ruled yesterday.  And you think they'll have that hand count done overnight?  

If Trump had an earlier lead of in-person ballots, which are counted first, and then was overtaken by ballots that were cast early, or by mail, how is that suspicious?  If the group likely to vote for you prefers in person voting (because a LARGE portion of those people are old and don't have to work), which are counted first, well, yeah, you're likely to be in the lead.  But shouldn't you want **all** legitimate ballots to be counted?  As I stated above, mail in ballots are counted last, and even this year, some stated are not allowing mail in ballots that arrive before election day to be counted early.  Why is that?

The DNC blocked Bernie...because Bernie isn't a Democrat!  He's not part of the party.  He's an independent.  He had about as much chance of winning the nomination as RFK, Jr. did this year.  Biden was strong.  And he decided to step aside and not run in 2016 against Trump.  After Trump won, he decided to come back in and Make Politics Boring Again.  If Biden wasn't a strong candidate, he wouldn't have garnered the record shattering amount of votes he received.  

Why is it weird the left responded to *accusations* of voter fraud (with no evidence),  but it's not weird for Trump and his surrogates to behave the way they did when his own [Attorney General admitted there was no voter fraud](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d)?

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1667,"From a social democrat perspective of what I’ve seen when people try to explain to them why trump should be disqualified. It’s all due to cognitive bias.

1) conservatives who believe don’t challenge their cognitive bias when they listen to the claim. This means any time you point out how he legitimately was attempting to overthrow the results an election they will go on a cognitive bias train:
He used fake slates of electors -> no they were just alternates
He admitted they were fake in court -> well ok but that was just there was election fraud
There was no fraud -> there was fraud I watched a propaganda film that says there was
That was all disproven in court -> the courts are biased
The judges were republicans and appointed by trump -> they are RINOS and paid off

It just goes on and on since they approach it from “trump is right” and they view the facts around how to excuse him instead of viewing the facts and deciding off them.

2) when you raise Jan 6 their cognitive bias prevents them from forming the logical conclusion that Jan 6 was the culmination of the attempt to overthrow the election.

Trump said at one point 20 minutes in “peaceful” one time. He spent the next 40 minutes telling them to fight for their country or they will lose it. Cognitive bias homes in on this one time he said peaceful and ignores the other 40 minutes of incitement.

It also ignores all the other points made about Trump telling them that Mike Pence failed to do what he did and them yelling “hang mike pence” based on that. I don’t properly understand how they cognitive bias this away, they tend to get caught up here.

3) they respond here with either 2 methods - they see it and think it’s worth the price of admission.
Or they see it and think that behaviour that would be disrespectful and distasteful for anyone else is funny because it represents rejection of politics as usual which has left them behind. Even if anyone else engaged in it they would think that - it’s all applied through the prism of the individual.

4) those who have become enamoured of trump allow him to shape their principles instead of holding to their principles. It’s why republicans pretend to anti-war when during the Iraq war they lambasted any suggestion of withdrawing from Iraq as “cutting and running”. 

So giving up supposed principles about small government is easy. For politicians this was always just a song and dance anyway - the national debt increased by $5 trillion under George bush.

5) large numbers of right wing people have a strongly authoritarian streak and so his outright embrace of fascism is a selling point to these people, not a disqualification.

6) for MAGA it doesn’t matter, cognitive bias. Those who oppose trump are RINOs or warmongers. This is why people on the left say the MAGAs are in a cult.

For the ones that it’s the price of admission they downplay it mentally, still cognitive bias but it’s justified away as “ but the policies…”.",Murranji,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,stolen election,-0.0102813852813853,GeppettoCat

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1667,"Covid happened in Trump’s last year of office, when no one knew much about it or how to handle it.

Seems silly to blame him in retrospect for not handling it “correctly” when it was such an unknown.

Heck, people were still claiming the lab leak theory was “debunked” & “misinformation,” & we now know it was true.

Trump relied on his medical advisors, Fauci & Birx, which in retrospect was a mistake. However, the left GLORIFIED Fauci, so it seems hypocritical to bash Trump for his handling of COVID when he was relying on the alleged “science” of Fauci whom the left adored.

Sweden handled it best by not shutting things down, but in 2020 US democrats overwhelmingly bashed Sweden’s approach & pushed hard for severe lockdowns.

Trump rushed an mRNA vaccine, which was another mistake, but again liberals ended up worshipping the vaccine and demonizing anyone who wouldn’t take it. Indeed, the Biden regime then mandated the mRNA shots, at the cost of people’s careers & freedom of travel if they did not comply with the intrusion on their bodies.

So again, it is hypocritical for the left to years later claim Trump handled COVID poorly in the first year of the unprecedented virus.

As for Nikki Haley, she’s just another warmongering puppet for the establishment & military industrial complex.

Or, if the only thing you care about is having a federal right to abortion, so that every state is forced to allow abortion rather than leaving it to the elected legislatures of each individual state, & are willing to prioritize abortion over averting nuclear war, Kamala is the better option.

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1667,"A few things I want to state more broadly as they are consistent in some other posts.  

1. I was wrong about the officer dying due to Jan. 6th injuries. He was hurt during the riot but his death shortly after was ruled natural causes. But officers were injured and that doesn't fit with my beliefs. I also do believe that if Trump hadn't spread the stolen election lie, then a bunch of patriotic people wouldn't have stormed the Capitol in the first place and all of those people would be alive. I believe Trump knows his impact on people and would be smart enough to know his rhetoric would have an impact. He may may not have known it would lead to storming the Capitol, but we often hold people accountable for unintended consequences (e.g. involuntary manslaughter), so I don't find holding him culpable to be a stretch.

2. I believe if Trump really wanted to solve problems and also help the republican party, he would have encouraged the congress republicans to vote yes on the immigration bill. This would have given many republican senators something else to run on and I would have seen that as a favorable action, refuting some of my beliefs about him, and may have swung my vote back in his favor. I would have at least considered it more so.

  
3. The economy keeps coming up. I think Trump will win and I think it will be about the economy. A lot of us have felt hardships during these past 4 years due to inflation. A lot of that inflation came from both Trump's stimulus and also Biden's expanded child tax credit. I have a hard time assigning blame for inflation entirely to either administration, especially since inflation was so bad globally. I do appreciate how when rates rose, we avoided a recession and kept employment near full employment - historically 4% - 4.3% is considered full employment by the Fed and LBS. I'm fortunate to not live on the margins and perhaps the limits to how inflation has or hasn't impacted me influences me differently. But as nation we've toughed out several recessions and we'll do it again. Both economic plans are said to add to the deficit, with Trump's adding more so. I did watch the entire interview he had with the Chicago Economic club but he didn't have any good answers as to how his plans wouldn't create the recession and debt forecasted. Instead he resulted to name calling, which, again, is a turn off for me. So for my remaining conservatives out there who have the economy in mind- I hear you and understand the choice you want to make there but I haven't seen anything credible there that would warrant moving past the concerns I expressed in my original post.",GeppettoCat,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,stolen election,0.11593193843193846,GeppettoCat

Askpolitics,Question for all. Can america survive becoming an isolationist nation?,21,"“Can America survive without our globalist friends” 

I don’t think so. Our economy isn’t structured to produce everything we need. 

Lots of our pharmaceuticals depend on certain ingredients imported from China that we aren’t setup to produce ourselves.

We import a lot of our oil & gas to meet demand. 

Some rare earth metals used in batteries  & in technology manufacturing aren’t found in the USA.

Garments & textiles & footwear are mainly produced internationally due to lower labor costs. 

Most appliances are imported. 

I can go on and on.

The complexity & sheer idiocy of trying inshore EVERYTHING is ridiculous. Isolationism is choosing, on purpose to pay more for everything. This slows our economic growth & could actually do the opposite. 

Life will ABSOLUTELY be harder if this happens.

Want examples? 

Post-World War I Germany: 

After the Treaty of Versailles, Germany faced severe economic isolation, leading to hyperinflation and economic collapse. The Dawes Plan of 1924 restructured reparations and facilitated foreign loans, reintegrating Germany into the global economy. Things improved & returned to normal almost immediately.

Post-Civil War United States: The U.S. South’s economic isolation during the Civil War resulted in widespread poverty. Rejoining the Union and reopening trade routes were vital for economic recovery.

Post-World War II Japan: Japan’s economy was devastated by the war and subsequent isolation. The U.S. occupation and the opening of trade channels were instrumental in Japan’s rapid economic recovery.

Post-Apartheid South Africa: International sanctions during apartheid led to economic stagnation. The end of apartheid and the reopening of trade relations spurred significant economic growth.

Post-Soviet Russia: The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to economic isolation and hardship. Engaging in global trade agreements and opening markets were key to Russia’s economic stabilization.

Post-Civil War Spain: Spain’s economic isolation during the Spanish Civil War resulted in stagnation. Rejoining international trade organizations and opening markets facilitated economic recovery.

Post-World War II Italy: Italy’s economy was in ruins after the war. Participating in the Marshall Plan and reopening trade routes were essential for its economic revival.

Post-Communist Eastern Europe: Countries like Poland and Hungary faced economic isolation under communist regimes. Transitioning to market economies and engaging in international trade were pivotal for their economic development.

Post-Civil War China: After the Chinese Civil War, the mainland’s economic isolation led to stagnation. Opening up to foreign trade and investment in the late 20th century spurred rapid economic growth.

Post-World War II France: France’s economy was devastated by the war. Participating in the European Coal and Steel Community and later the European Economic Community facilitated its economic recovery.

Askpolitics,Is it true that Republican party turning left and Democratic party turning right?,0,"Globalism was originally pushed for by Nixion and Reagan. 

It was quite successful and so Clinton jumped on it too, riding the economic wave it created.

Globalism has been an aggregate benefit but those benefits have been uneven, and at the expense of workers.

So globalism was originally a right leaning concept (understanding economics better, as you say) at the objection of the left (workers unions, et).

Over time that has flipped, and so too have some voters - most notably in the Great Lakes.

You have to reconcile the tradeoff for being globalist - which primarily benefits big business and knowledge workers - while simultaneously claiming to be for the working class. It’s somewhat at odds.

Trying to claim a couple crumbs and redistricting them to the bottom 20% (via whatever tax credit or minimum wage) is pain reduction for a pretty small percent of the population, not a solution for those not benefitting from said globalism.",Kman17,1,2025-02-04 18:15:24,globalist,0.29362244897959183,CheeseOnMyFingies

The media and opposing politicians are presenting it as Musk making the calls, but that seems to be more of an intent to promote the oligarchy line. 

Soros does everything behind the scenes, but the information available is that he's had great influence at all levels from local to federal. He may not be in the public eye, but I think he's had direct influence on those he helps elect. The biggest difference is that his goal seems to be consolidated power and not rooting out waste. His known history of crashing the British pound is a credible fear to have about his intentions. 

Both are citizens, and both have a right to make decisions affecting their government. Unchecked, either running free to do what they want, especially if the intent is to profit from it or weaken the nation as a whole, is absolutely an issue. Unfortunately, power has been consistently reversed from our states being in control to top down. That consolidation of power at the top lends itself to very few making the decisions that affect everything.

The debate over what that means was anticipated by the Founding Father's to be so varied and heated, that they didn't want one person (the President) making those decisions.  That's why the power of to spend the government's money is solely given to Congress.

When you say that what you voted for was for Trump to stop the spending of ""All the BS that doesn't benefit Americans,""  if you let him do that without the cooperation of Congress, you're eliminating the chief protection of the Constitution from having a temporary King, instead of a President.  

You can't just change the form of government as it suits you and say, ""yay!""  Unless you don't actually believe in our system of government anymore.  

If you want Trump to be King, say so.  But don't pretend that it's business as usual as he acts completely beyond his powers under the Constitution.

Depending on how long you've been a Republican, we anticipated the surprise or concern from conservatives, because they had a history of upholding their principles, even when unpopular.  

These actions are not based in principal.  They're based on rooting for the home team to win, no matter what.

Russia, to North Korea, to Cuba, they are all examples of it hitting critical mass.

I have considered it. I give eggs and other produce to my neighbors, free of charge, just to be a good neighbor. To build good relations with them.  I also charge people money for my eggs. I also trade eggs for credit at the local roadside produce stand and walk away with produce.

But the foundation of my complaint is, granting others power over my production rate, input on my production processes, command of my distribution, this is authoritarianism over me, locally. When you regulate me, your justification is I'm harboring moral turpitude. And I then have to submit to your judgement or face consequences. I don't harbor that. It would be a lie to admit to it. It's oppressive to make me.

At the core of the appeal to communism, you're telling me I'm required to trust someone else to care for me and mine like I do. I don't. Thats the crux of the problem here.

I voted for Trump because it's short term holding off that nightmare. It's absolutely coming eventually. I won't be his first target. Again, the left is unreasonable. They are not introspective. They can't self-reflect, self correct, admit when they got something wrong. Their character is such that it does not build trust.

Republicans complained about election fraud. The left denied it. There are thousands of examples of what we called a perversion of justice. Ignored. Double standards and sweet-heart deals for special interests. If the left actually cared about the right, they'd pause, they seriously consider what the right has said. They'd investigate and make sure they and their departments handled it even handedly. But not so much as a gesture. Every time someone goes against the left narrative, they get very publicly flogged and excommunicated. And we on the right are watching and listening.

I can go on, but instead I want to point out why did Joe pardon nearly 11 years of hunters crimes when all huter was being charged with is the gun false documentation charges.

Look into barismas which was 8ish years ago. Ukraine found corruption in the company barisma, hunter worked for barisma at the time. Hunters laptop also had evidence hunter was paying Joe Biden 10% of the money barisma paid to hunter. Even though hunter has been pardoned he still has to fallow the supena(or he gets a new federal charge, just ask Bannon) and because hunter no longer has to defend himself he can no longer plead the fifth(right to not self-incriminate).

Now hunter has to answer all questions asked of him, and fallow the supena or else he will end up in prison despite everything his dad did to protect hunter.

Askpolitics,"Why is Biden planning on pardoning Fauci, Cheney and Schiff if supposedly they did nothing wrong?",4644,"Why?   
Because he is completely corrupt as proven by the historically unprecedented blanket pardon for his son.  
 Joe Biden ranks **last** among all U.S. presidents in terms of the total number of pardons granted since the clemency statistics have been recorded. With a measly **26 pardons** issued during his presidency (as of December 2024),  
He could have pardoned thousands of people currently in prison for smoking weed or minor crimes, but instead he pardoned crackhead Hunter knowing full well that an investigation into Hunter's Burisma dealings would show that he was personally involved in the scam and has received kickbacks himself. That's why the pardon covered all the way to 2104 when Hunter started getting access bribes.   
Joe is a disgrace. His pardoning (once again preemptively of Fauci) shows that knows Fauci is guilty of crimes against humanity and lying to congress and American people, while making himself insanely rich during the pandemic. 

Hopefully this will be Biden's foundational legacy.

Askpolitics,"Why is Biden planning on pardoning Fauci, Cheney and Schiff if supposedly they did nothing wrong?",4644,"I think there are several ways to answer this question, which I also asked myself.

The thing about Trump is, it’s never quite clear to me whether his diehard supporters and diehard detractors each think that we are all supposed to 100% believe everything he says or 100% think everything he says is a joke.  Each side sometimes seems to think one of these and sometimes think the other.  

So for example is he gonna somehow have a million people in the country rounded up and stuck somewhere really really soon after he takes office because these people have an immigration issue?  Both big time Trump lovers and big time Trump haters seem to think that’s 100% true, even though it’s clearly logistically impossible.  He obviously wants to do some stuff about people with immigration issues and I’m sure he will try and some of the methods proposed do sound scary and/or of dubious legality.  But some of the ways people on both sides are talking about some of the things he’s said seem to me like 100% belief in rhetorical points that won’t be true.

So then Trump says something like Mark Milley could/should be killed for treason or Liz Cheney should try having nine guns pointed at her or so forth, and some on the far extremes of each side also think he’s being 100% serious about *this* stuff too.

So, I think Trump’s ability to word-salad anything has caused an inability among many people (perhaps including himself) to know if anything he says is 100% true or 100% false.  Everything he says could be either, or nothing he says could be either.  I suspect he likes this and does it sort of on purpose because for one reason then there’s so much to try to fact check that it drives people nuts.

In cases such as Fauci, Cheney, Schiff - I think the pardons are bring considered because people are under the notion that Trump 100% means some of the threats he has made against these people who have done nothing wrong.  I think that’s ridiculous, he doesn’t mean them, Trump threatens everybody with everything all the time but just like the wall isn’t finished and Mexico didn’t pay for it, Hillary Clinton isn’t  locked up and in fact was never even really investigated, certainly not charged.  People are taking Trump’s bullying rhetoric too literally and were pre-emptive pardons actually to be issued it would be a terrible terrible idea.

Another reason why it’s probably being discussed at this time by this administration though it clearly should’ve been just rejected out of hand is because (I know downvotes are coming) Biden is not all there and he’s surrounded by people who are freaking OUT that Trump won.  Because they’ve bought in to the notion that 100% of what Trump has said is true and is what he’s going to do.  Which it wasn’t last time, isn’t this time, and has been demonstrated, by some of those same people, over and over again.  Donald Trump is a liar.  That’s obvious.  So why believe his “threats” to these people that is just him being a bully?",hungtopbost,2,2024-12-06 12:16:33,fauci,-0.04222789115646258,LetsFuckOnTheBoat

Askpolitics,"Why is Biden planning on pardoning Fauci, Cheney and Schiff if supposedly they did nothing wrong?",4644,"To me, he too often stated things as fact that he either knew were not facts, or should have.  He also seemed to mix his politics and his science, which isn't how it's supposed to work.

1. He started off the pandemic by telling a noble lie about N-95 masks not being helpful (so there wouldn't be a shortage).  It's impossible to know if some lives could have been saved if grandma got an N-95, but it doesn't seem outrageous to suggest that.  This also wasn't based on science.
2. He dismissed the lab leak theory out of hand and encouraged social media companies to label posts about it ""misinformation"".  We still don't know where it came from.
3. When some prominent scientists questioned the wisdom of a complete lockdown, Fauci emailed [“There needs to be a quick and devastating published take down of its premises,](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2874776/fauci-has-destroyed-the-credibility-of-the-public-health-establishment/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Pmax_USA_Magazine_21-June-Intent-Audience-Signals&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIleui1sKVhwMV7QWtBh0AnAfAEAMYASAAEgJT8PD_BwE)”.  He wasn't interested in scientific debate, he was interested in his POV prevailing.
4. As far as the infamous 6 ft. rule goes, Fauci admitted in closed door testimony that the rule [“sort of just appeared” without a solid scientific basis.](https://archive.is/fzNZd#selection-4657.191-4657.288)
5. He said the vaccine would prevent transmission despite a notable lack of evidence.  
6. He kept revising his ""herd immunity"" number up (from 60 to 80%) as Americans continued to get the vaccine (another noble lie not based on science).
7. He said that if you are criticize him, you are criticizing science.   The problem is that Fauci clearly did not always follow the science.  It also speaks to a pretty big ego.  The same ego that led to him hanging a  painting of himself above his desk in his office.  Yikes.
8. When Congress looked into our handling of COVID, [they uncovered a (likely successful) scheme by top NIH officials to delete their emails in order to avoid Freedom of Information Act requests. ](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fauci-denies-suppressing-covid-lab-leak-theory-before-us-house-panel-2024-06-03/) Fauci denies participating in the scheme, but the truth is we will really never know.

I think that Fauci committed crimes against science but, I don't think, that they are covered by criminal law.

He poisoned investigations into COVID origins to protect his reputation and injected far too much politics into science but, I doubt that, there is anything in the statute books that says those are crimes in the legal sense. He undermined people's trust in science and lead the way to the democrat's defeat in the last election. (Democrats and scientists: he did you no favours, he took care of his own self interest.)

But his defence against perjury charges would be, ""it depends on your definition of GoF"" and that wont make an interesting court case.

He is the reason that I can start a blog with a picture of the capitol building on it right now and write about how awesome he is and make a ton of money. He is perhaps the only president who is so into being praised that he can be manipulated by dictators around the world and praise them. Even when Kim Jung Un called him a dotard, so many people have such a terrible vocabulary that they thought he was making up the word. He has said that they are friends while Kim has said he hates him and he is a weak and selfish person. It was frankly, embarrassing to see that so many people in the US had either never heard the word or wouldn’t google it to know that he managed to get an English word that describes him perfectly yet Trump went with “Little Rocket Man” like the schoolyard bully he is. He has the soul of a Nelson Muntz with the intellect of Eric Cartman. 

I keep hearing all of this FAFO and buyers remorse from voters and yes people googled “how can I change my vote” but that says more about his voters. I personally haven’t seen any evidence of any MAGAts, who are actually upset or regretful. They don’t know what tariffs are and don’t care, they don’t care who gets deported because it won’t happen to them and if it does it’s because of the “deep state” not Trump. He could shit in their mouth and tell them it’s a Hershey bar and they would gladly pay him for the cost of the candy bar. 

Of course, any adults are going to be upset and write bad articles when that is literally all he gives them to write about. It was an eye opener watching the coverage of the debate from Fox and on CNN when Trump said “they’re eating the dogs” because Fox just ignored it. But even they aren’t right wing enough anymore. It’s worse than Fox, if that’s possible. I’m waiting to see who the next Goebbels is, because if Hitler can find someone to write for him, so can Trump.

And now, Marjorie Taylor Greene can call the FBI the “Gazpacho” and it doesn’t even make the news anymore because they are so used to stupid things coming from they side, nothing moves the needle on the right, anymore. It’s a shameful state of affairs. And we could have stopped it but even people who hate him would rather not vote or vote for Kamala, because they don’t like her more than they think he’s terrible.

Askpolitics,To what extent to the left and right use propaganda?,25,"While there is obviously propaganda on both sides, it is extremely important to look into the intent of the propaganda and the bigger picture 

There is substantial evidence indicating Russian efforts to sway U.S. voters to the political right, particularly through the use of propaganda. Key findings come from investigations and research by U.S. intelligence agencies, academic studies, and independent organizations. Here’s a summary of the evidence:

1. U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA, 2017)

The U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump. The assessment noted:
	•	Russian state-sponsored actors, including the Internet Research Agency (IRA), conducted an information campaign aimed at polarizing U.S. society.
	•	Efforts included boosting pro-Trump content and targeting left-leaning voters with divisive material to suppress turnout.

Source: Intelligence Community Assessment, 2017

2. Senate Intelligence Committee Reports

The Senate Intelligence Committee’s bipartisan investigation into Russian interference revealed:
	•	The IRA used social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to amplify right-leaning narratives.
	•	Targeted disinformation campaigns aimed to appeal to conservative voters, focusing on issues like immigration, gun rights, and patriotism.
	•	Some ads and posts were explicitly pro-Trump, while others attacked Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates.

Source: Senate Intelligence Committee Report, 2020

3. Misinformation on Social Media
	•	Facebook and Twitter Analysis: Studies show that Russian operatives created millions of posts designed to manipulate U.S. political discourse. These posts disproportionately targeted right-wing groups by promoting conspiracy theories, nationalism, and divisive cultural issues.
	•	The IRA created fake accounts impersonating Americans to infiltrate right-wing communities and amplify narratives like the Clinton email scandal and “deep state” conspiracies.

Study Example: University of Oxford’s Computational Propaganda Project, 2018

4. Targeting Evangelicals and Conservative Groups

The Russian campaign frequently targeted evangelical Christians and conservative groups by:
	•	Promoting anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, and pro-gun messages.
	•	Amplifying narratives about religious persecution to rally conservative voters.

Source: Columbia Journalism Review, 2018

5. Support for Right-Wing Populism Beyond 2016

Even beyond the 2016 election, Russian propaganda has continued to favor right-wing populist movements, often by:
	•	Spreading narratives that undermine faith in democratic institutions.
	•	Supporting polarizing figures on the right to create political instability.

Why Focus on the Right?

Experts suggest that Russia’s goal was less about supporting specific candidates and more about undermining U.S. democracy. By aligning with right-wing narratives, Russian propaganda could exploit pre-existing cultural divides and amplify political polarization.

Hunter Biden has been investigated 3 times already. 

Trumps DOJ and FBI had the laptop in 2020 when Rudy gave it to them. They investigated. It led nowhere. Trump illegally asked zelensky for help digging up dirt on Hunter/Joe. He was impeached for it. First investigation found nothing.


Biden ordered a special prosecutor be put in charge of the continuing investigation or hunter. Biden did that because he can't be impartial. Special prosecutor found tax charges, gun charges/drug charges. Hunter was convicted on all counts and needs to pay back taxes.


Third investigation is by Republican House oversight committee. They specifically look at hunters dealings in Ukraine and China. They think they have something and they don't. The only salacious testimony is found to be lies. That witness is later tried and just recently convicted of perjury and other charges. The oversight committee cannot draw any straight lines from Joe Biden to Burisma or any other Ukraine or China money. They refer no one to DOJ for crimes. Third investigation found nothing.

Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1670,"From a social democrat perspective of what I’ve seen when people try to explain to them why trump should be disqualified. It’s all due to cognitive bias.

1) conservatives who believe don’t challenge their cognitive bias when they listen to the claim. This means any time you point out how he legitimately was attempting to overthrow the results an election they will go on a cognitive bias train:
He used fake slates of electors -> no they were just alternates
He admitted they were fake in court -> well ok but that was just there was election fraud
There was no fraud -> there was fraud I watched a propaganda film that says there was
That was all disproven in court -> the courts are biased
The judges were republicans and appointed by trump -> they are RINOS and paid off

It just goes on and on since they approach it from “trump is right” and they view the facts around how to excuse him instead of viewing the facts and deciding off them.

2) when you raise Jan 6 their cognitive bias prevents them from forming the logical conclusion that Jan 6 was the culmination of the attempt to overthrow the election.

Trump said at one point 20 minutes in “peaceful” one time. He spent the next 40 minutes telling them to fight for their country or they will lose it. Cognitive bias homes in on this one time he said peaceful and ignores the other 40 minutes of incitement.

It also ignores all the other points made about Trump telling them that Mike Pence failed to do what he did and them yelling “hang mike pence” based on that. I don’t properly understand how they cognitive bias this away, they tend to get caught up here.

3) they respond here with either 2 methods - they see it and think it’s worth the price of admission.
Or they see it and think that behaviour that would be disrespectful and distasteful for anyone else is funny because it represents rejection of politics as usual which has left them behind. Even if anyone else engaged in it they would think that - it’s all applied through the prism of the individual.

4) those who have become enamoured of trump allow him to shape their principles instead of holding to their principles. It’s why republicans pretend to anti-war when during the Iraq war they lambasted any suggestion of withdrawing from Iraq as “cutting and running”. 

So giving up supposed principles about small government is easy. For politicians this was always just a song and dance anyway - the national debt increased by $5 trillion under George bush.

5) large numbers of right wing people have a strongly authoritarian streak and so his outright embrace of fascism is a selling point to these people, not a disqualification.

6) for MAGA it doesn’t matter, cognitive bias. Those who oppose trump are RINOs or warmongers. This is why people on the left say the MAGAs are in a cult.

For the ones that it’s the price of admission they downplay it mentally, still cognitive bias but it’s justified away as “ but the policies…”.",Murranji,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,biden crime family,-0.0102813852813853,GeppettoCat
Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1670,"Obviously fake post.

There weren't any Haley supporters

Trump was a wild card in 2016, he was a lifelong Democrat running as a conservative. 

He governed very moderately,  he was anti regulation,  protected American manufacturing and was fairly anti war.  He did a lot of good for middle east diplomacy.

Arguably his worst time as president was pandemic,  he wanted to shut down border/ travel ban to Asia but was called a racist and was strong armed into keeping it open,  poured money into economy after listening to Anthony ""I am the science"" fauci.


Take the pandemic away and he was a very solid president. 

What exactly made you vote for trump over Hillary but now you wouldn't vote for Trump over an extremely far left candidate?",Professional_Oil3057,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,biden crime family,0.032986111111111105,GeppettoCat
Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1670,"Covid happened in Trump’s last year of office, when no one knew much about it or how to handle it.

Seems silly to blame him in retrospect for not handling it “correctly” when it was such an unknown.

Heck, people were still claiming the lab leak theory was “debunked” & “misinformation,” & we now know it was true.

Trump relied on his medical advisors, Fauci & Birx, which in retrospect was a mistake. However, the left GLORIFIED Fauci, so it seems hypocritical to bash Trump for his handling of COVID when he was relying on the alleged “science” of Fauci whom the left adored.

Sweden handled it best by not shutting things down, but in 2020 US democrats overwhelmingly bashed Sweden’s approach & pushed hard for severe lockdowns.

Trump rushed an mRNA vaccine, which was another mistake, but again liberals ended up worshipping the vaccine and demonizing anyone who wouldn’t take it. Indeed, the Biden regime then mandated the mRNA shots, at the cost of people’s careers & freedom of travel if they did not comply with the intrusion on their bodies.

So again, it is hypocritical for the left to years later claim Trump handled COVID poorly in the first year of the unprecedented virus.

As for Nikki Haley, she’s just another warmongering puppet for the establishment & military industrial complex.

If you want to keep pushing us into foreign wars, endless spending on foreign aid, & ever closer to World War 3 & global nuclear annihilation, then I can see why she was your preference, & why Kamala is the next best option.

Or, if the only thing you care about is having a federal right to abortion, so that every state is forced to allow abortion rather than leaving it to the elected legislatures of each individual state, & are willing to prioritize abortion over averting nuclear war, Kamala is the better option.

For those who want to put the U.S. first, limit foreign spending, get out of foreign wars, & avoid WW3 & nuclear war, Trump is the superior option, even if you don’t like his personality.",Swimming-Buyer7052,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,biden crime family,0.08144573144573145,GeppettoCat
Askpolitics,Haley supporter voting for Harris - fellow conservatives what am I missing,1670,"A few things I want to state more broadly as they are consistent in some other posts.  

1. I was wrong about the officer dying due to Jan. 6th injuries. He was hurt during the riot but his death shortly after was ruled natural causes. But officers were injured and that doesn't fit with my beliefs. I also do believe that if Trump hadn't spread the stolen election lie, then a bunch of patriotic people wouldn't have stormed the Capitol in the first place and all of those people would be alive. I believe Trump knows his impact on people and would be smart enough to know his rhetoric would have an impact. He may may not have known it would lead to storming the Capitol, but we often hold people accountable for unintended consequences (e.g. involuntary manslaughter), so I don't find holding him culpable to be a stretch.

2. I believe if Trump really wanted to solve problems and also help the republican party, he would have encouraged the congress republicans to vote yes on the immigration bill. This would have given many republican senators something else to run on and I would have seen that as a favorable action, refuting some of my beliefs about him, and may have swung my vote back in his favor. I would have at least considered it more so.

  
3. The economy keeps coming up. I think Trump will win and I think it will be about the economy. A lot of us have felt hardships during these past 4 years due to inflation. A lot of that inflation came from both Trump's stimulus and also Biden's expanded child tax credit. I have a hard time assigning blame for inflation entirely to either administration, especially since inflation was so bad globally. I do appreciate how when rates rose, we avoided a recession and kept employment near full employment - historically 4% - 4.3% is considered full employment by the Fed and LBS. I'm fortunate to not live on the margins and perhaps the limits to how inflation has or hasn't impacted me influences me differently. But as nation we've toughed out several recessions and we'll do it again. Both economic plans are said to add to the deficit, with Trump's adding more so. I did watch the entire interview he had with the Chicago Economic club but he didn't have any good answers as to how his plans wouldn't create the recession and debt forecasted. Instead he resulted to name calling, which, again, is a turn off for me. So for my remaining conservatives out there who have the economy in mind- I hear you and understand the choice you want to make there but I haven't seen anything credible there that would warrant moving past the concerns I expressed in my original post.",GeppettoCat,1,2024-10-18 17:23:04,biden crime family,0.11593193843193846,GeppettoCat

Askpolitics,"Poll: For the Right, Trump was reelected due to?",171,"How exactly have democrats done better on the economy?

Biden caused pretty substantial inflation, and there’s a strong argument that democratic policy around Covid didn’t change outcomes and was economically damaging.

Trump is difficult to assess as COVID blew up his economy and literally everyone else’s on the globe.

Obama was fine. Slow and stable overall, but pretty major income inequality growth for a party that supposedly champions the middle class.

George W was bad. Combo of over exertion of military plus cuts bubbled and didn’t work.

Clinton was goo but he basically just inherited and continued Reagan’s / GH’s globalist policy.

Reagan / Bush were great.

Carter was an absolute disaster.

Nixon / Ford were fine, at least looking ahead with China.

Everyone before that was simply sharing the spoils of winning WW2. They didn’t create the engine, just shared it.

Almost all those administrations had the opposing party control the house or senate during their term. Divided government is the norm.

So to even take credit during democratic administrations you’re kinda forgetting republicans controlled the budgets.",Kman17,1,2025-01-14 13:16:26,biden crime family,0.12395833333333335,teb_art
