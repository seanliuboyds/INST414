Conservative,QAnon Is Destroying the GOP From Within,6912,"Trump was more nationalist than most of the GOP.  Nationalism is to America what globalism is to the world.  Nationalist policies put American interests first, even if they created heartache abroad; however, a nation's interests are inherent to its strength in a global environment.  This has been proven and is widely studied in the academic world.  

Nationalist policies required Trump to deal with other nations on the merits of each country - individually.  This is why he pulled the U.S. away from one-sided foreign polices like the Paris Climate accord and the Pacific Trans-whatever.  He wanted to deal with nations individually while not committing the U.S. to a globalist policy that only America would abide by.  

Domestically, he fought for justice reform, accomplishing more than career politicians did in decades.  He wanted stronger borders and better security while expressing his belief in many Americans across a wider spectrum than the GOP was known for.  He explicitly stated this during many of his rallies, including support for minorities and the LGTB community.

However, the way he spoke and his Tweets angered many and gave misconceptions about his intent.  Additionally, the hatred many felt towards him because HRC lost 2016 was pretty blatant and cost Trump in the long run due to the left's wide support in MSM and within social media platforms.  This is more political, though than the policies of above.  

He reduced regulations, or attempted to and wanted to pass legislation regarding America's infrastructure.  His policies also brought back manufacturing jobs as he challenged China on many fronts.  Love him or hate him, many of his policies actually benefited the U.S.  He just pissed a lot of people off.  Studying some of his foreign policy decisions in school have been eye opening.  His peace negotiations in the Middle East have been more fruitful than ANY president in decades.  

TL/DR:  His policies and ideals were nationalistic.  Most politicians, on both sides, are globalist in nature - catering to their specific voting blocks during re-election season.  Yes, he likely had/has an occult following but he has done a lot for the U.S.",Jamesfm007,545,2021-01-20 12:17:39,QAnon,0.1126984126984127,campingkayak
Conservative,QAnon Is Destroying the GOP From Within,6912,">One thing about questionable ballots was a large number of single-vote ballots that were for Biden and no one else. If the focus was solely on the White House, then falsifying such ballots would make sense.

Wouldn't it also just make more sense that there was a huge push to get people to go out and vote solely to get Trump out? So people who ordinarily don't ever vote went out and cast the only vote they were being pushed on casting. That's a far more simple and logical explanation in my opinion, than ""we were too lazy to fill in two extra bubbles when committing the largest election fraud in American history without leaving any evidence"". 

>That states flipped overnight, after they said counting had stopped, was highly suspect.

I'm still not sure where people are getting this from. I was pretty glued to the ""TV""(laptop stream) on election night up until after midnight and never heard anything about counting stopping. But even if that was announced, isn't it possible it was just...wrong? Or that counting did indeed stop, but that doesn't mean reporting *of that count* stopped? Both things can be true without there being a conspiracy. You can announce that you've stopped counting, and then release results of the last count. 

I'm sure if we went back to 2016, there were also ""weird ballot dumps from cities"" then too. Cities have more people so they take longer to count and prefer to release the count of a bunch of votes at once rather than in increments.  

A lot of weird things happen everyday, but it isn't until something major also occurs there that those weird things are scrutinized and end up fueling conspiracies. Today I hit 10/12 red lights on my drive to work. If a car accident were to occur toward the end of my commute and I wasn't involved, I could attribute it to an act of God if I was religious. But the truth is nothing happened, and it would've just been a coincidence if something did rather than a mysterious force stopping me from being where I would've been had I gotten more green lights. Just as I'm sure weird things happen every election, but because the election didn't have one person calling it fraudulent, no one paid any mind to it. 

To Trump's credit, at least he may cause our elections to become even more secure and transparent because election workers will know they're under scrutiny.",pkosuda,24,2021-01-20 12:17:39,QAnon,0.03560714285714286,cubs223425

Conservative,It’s over for the Deep State. Kash Patel has been picked to be the next FBI Director ,1917,"Help prove this wrong? Because I tried and I can't. My buddy, long time MAGA too, sent me this theory that messed me up:

""What if Trump has been the deep state all along or recruited by the deep state to do their bidding? Because.. it almost makes sense...

Sometimes, I wonder if Trump, who came across as an outsider and someone fighting the system, might actually be part of the ""deep state"" — this hidden group of powerful people, bureaucrats, and intelligence agents who run things behind the scenes. Here's how I think about it:

Fake Opposition -- Trump talked a lot about being against the system and ""draining the swamp."" But what if that was just a trick? Maybe he wanted people who are fed up with the system to think he was their guy. This way, they stayed involved in the system instead of pushing for bigger, real changes.

If that’s true, the deep state gets to keep things running as usual while making it seem like change is happening.

The Same Old Policies -- Even though Trump spoke out against globalism and endless wars, his actions sometimes told a different story. Under his leadership, things didn’t really change:
Military Spending: He gave the military more money and kept the U.S. involved in wars like the one in Afghanistan.
Big Business: He cut taxes for big corporations and removed regulations that helped them make more money.
Surveillance: He supported spying programs that gave the government more power over people’s privacy.

Even with all his tough talk, these moves seem to support the same old system. No?

Trump gave us things that felt like victories — like talking tough on immigration, slamming the media, or picking conservative judges. But did these things really shake up the power structure? Not really.

For example, while he promised to ""drain the swamp,"" he hired a lot of Washington insiders and lobbyists. It felt more like a show than real change tbh..

Keeping Us Divided -- Trump is kinda polarizing. People either love him or hate him. This constant fighting between groups kept us distracted. Instead of focusing on big issues like growing poverty, the power of big companies, or government overreach, we were too busy arguing with each other.

Some think this division helps the deep state stay in control. As long as we’re fighting each other, we can’t unite and fight back against real power.

Trust -- Trump painted himself as the people's hero — someone who would fight for regular folks. But if he didn’t really deliver on his promises, it could be a way to break our trust in any real anti-establishment movement. If people believe he’s the best shot at change and he lets them down, they might give up hope that change is even possible.

'But what About His Fights with the System??'
Some people say my theory that Trump is the deep state doesn’t make sense because Trump clearly fights with the media, intelligence agencies, and career bureaucrats. These clashes could mean he really was challenging the system.

But if you believe the deep state can play a long game and fool people with careful tricks, it’s possible those fights were just part of the act... If the deep state has been there all along, doing what they do, what makes you think they couldn't pull this off? The court cases, the media appearances, and if you actually believe in law and order, wouldnt he have been gone a long time ago with the things he's done and now he's able to pardon himself for whatever he's done? If this is true and Trump is part of the deep state then we're being played like a god damn fiddle...""

Conservative,It’s over for the Deep State. Kash Patel has been picked to be the next FBI Director ,1917,"It's a remarkable break from post-Watergate (and post J. Edgar Hoover) practice and an acceleration of the (public) politicalization of the Justice department.

Trump is going to fire the FBI Director that he appointed.  There is a lot of risk with this maneuver.  And the vetting needs to be solid.

Otherwise, he loses a lot of political capital.  And then the other risky picks include: Dr. Mehmet Oz, Pete Hegseth, and Robert Kennedy.  And just how independent is Robert Kennedy going to be, once approved?

Trump remains an outsider like Carter.  Take that as you will.  Trump is a media man and shapes the narrative while spinning chaos, but a drip-drip-drip of bad news from the confirmation hearings is gonna be tough.  And if the Dems position themselves as bending over backwards to wanting to confirm his nominees instead of knee-jerk opposition, they could really fail.

And the risk from the bureaucracy (deep state) isn't that it fights back, it's that it doesn't move.  Like fire all the folks you want and appoint all the loyal folks you'd like, but policy may not change.

So if you have a bureaucracy incapable of moving paper and faced with a significant loss of political capital, how are we going to deal with the deficit?    
  
I read Sen Ernst's proposals for upwards of $2 trillion in cuts, and it's all gimmicks spread out of a decade.  

The cuts need to happen through DoD, Social Security, and Medicare.  Or raise taxes like removing the income limit on Social Security/Medicare.  It's really that simple: decrease handouts to the old to let them live in poverty because it's not affordable, or raise taxes.

Trump needs to break his campaign promise and tackle these sacred cows.  Can we really afford to wait another four years?",cupidsodyssey,0,2024-11-30 19:22:16,deep state,0.006703397612488521,Arachnohybrid

Regardless, yes, I am a Lefty and I never heard of any Democrat I know who did not think the Patriot Act should be repealed.  In fact, no one I know thought it should be passed in the first place and the same goes for the creation of the Homeland Security Department. All of that was done as an over-reaction to 9/11 by the Bush Administration. I am pretty sure that Democratic politicians have been afraid to shut down the Act and/or the Department because they are afraid of Republicans painting the as anti-patriotic.  My guess is that, while Democrats in Congress would gladly vote to pass it, they would, for that same reason, be afraid to introduce it. So, the repealer will need to be introduced by the Republicans and it is hard to imagine that the Democrats would not vote overwhelmingly for such a bill.

I strongly believe the right should quit the ""stolen election"" narrative and focus on keeping the Senate.

The whole world was filled with wonder(I) and followed the beast. 4 People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like(J) the beast? Who can wage war against it?”
5 The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies(K) and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.(L) 6 It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.(M) 7 It was given power to wage war(N) against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.(O) 8 All inhabitants of the earth(P) will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life,(Q) the Lamb(R) who was slain from the creation of the world.[b](S)

It also forced all people, great and small,(AL) rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,(AM) 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark,(AN) which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.(AO)

For those who like to connect the dots, you may recall a certain Venezuelan military official who apporached Powell with this information.

And I have no doubt that Murdoch would deny the election fraud and illegality that occured. He clearly voted for Biden and had his network run cover for Democrats in 2020. See for example when they called Arizona blue before the polls closed in order to suppress Trump votes and avoid ever showing him in the lead on their election graphic. The conservative debate on Fox was also the only time hidin' Biden would have to face and address conservative scrutiny before the election but Murdoch's Fox News did their part to protect him and put in Democrat Chris Wallace.

Likewise, it reviews the theory that COVID-19 was created by them in China because they couldn’t create it here, in order to test how much control they had with the myocarditis-inducing vaccines. And the sheeple listened. 

So, the leftists act like puppets of the globalist elite. The billionaires that take part in this are the ones in the WEF: Soros, for one. 

Lastly, I’d like to add that they pay the government to support their regime by mandating things like electric vehicles and mass-producing wind energy, which is probably causing a lot more environmental pollution because a 500-square-mile area of them is only enough to power a small Midwestern township, and only in windy days, too.",Any-Passion8322,34,2025-01-04 06:54:24,soros,0.1388888888888889,A_Blue_Frog_Child

These acts themselves of funding your beliefs in other parts of the world are not themselves ""evil"" unless what you are funding would be deemed evil, right? So shouldn't we examine the issues being pushed forward prior to vilifying the acts?

The next logical leap then taken is that he's spreading communism, which I believe is very damaging and leads to a form of tyranny, but that it's under the guise of BLM or Antifa. However when I see the message that those groups put forward it is more along the lines of libertarian or anarchist agendas.
